This document describes what query phrasing is, and shows how to
enable and use it in Vespa.
</p>

<p>
Often, users will search for phrases like e.g. <em>New
York</em>, <em>Rolling Stones</em>, <em>The Who</em>, or <em>daily
horoscopes</em>. Considering the latter, most of the time the query
string will look like this:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
/search/?query=daily horoscopes&amp;&hellip;
</pre>

<p>
This is actually a search for documents where both &ldquo;daily&rdquo;
and &ldquo;horoscopes&rdquo; match, but not necessarily documents with
the exact phrase &ldquo;daily horoscopes&rdquo;. This is where
PhrasingSearcher comes in. PhrasingSearcher is a QRS Searcher that
compares queries with a list of common phrases, and replaces two
single search terms with a phrase. So the above query becomes:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
/search/?query=&ldquo;daily horoscopes&rdquo;&amp;&hellip;
</pre>

<p>
if &ldquo;daily horoscopes&rdquo; is known to be a common phrase.
</p>

<p>
The PhrasingSearcher must be configured with a list of common
phrases. This list has to be <em>compiled</em> into an FSA file, which
is the file format that PhrasingSearcher uses.  To use the compiled
list, it has to be available on all QRS nodes and its location must be
referenced in the QRS configuration.
</p>



<h1 id="compiling-list">Compiling the List of Phrases</h1>

<p>
The list of phrases must be:
</p>

<ul>
<li>all lowercase</li>
<li>sorted alphabetically</li>
</ul>

<p>
To accomplish this, use:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ perl -ne 'print lc' listofphrasestextfile.unsorted.mixedcase > listofphrasestextfile.unsorted
$ sort listofphrasestextfile.unsorted > listofphrasestextfile
</pre>

<p>
Note that the Perl command to convert the text file to lowercase does
not handle non-ASCII characters very well. If the list of phrases is
e.g. UTF-8 encoded and/or contains non-English characters, you must
double-check that the resulting file is correct.
</p>

<p>
The <em>makefsa</em> program is used to compile a list of common
phrases into an FSA file. It is installed with Vespa.
</p>

<p>
The FSA can be compiled from the list of phrases:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ makefsa listofphrasestextfile phrasefsa
</pre>



<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>

<p>
The compiled list of phrases must be available on all QRS
nodes. <span data-annotation="Is this still true?">Currently,
distributing the file onto these nodes must be done manually.</span>
When it is present on the same location in the file system on all
nodes, add a <em>qr-searchers.cfg</em> file to the <em>configs/</em>
directory of
your <a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html#adding-cfg-files">application
package</a> with the following line:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
com.yahoo.prelude.querytransform.PhrasingSearcher.automatonfile &quot;<span class="marker1">/path/to/phrase/file</span>&quot;
</pre>

<p data-annotation="Does this use new configuration in XML?">
Replace the highlighted text with the path to your phrase file. If you
already have a <em>qr-searchers.cfg</em> file in
<em>configs/</em>, just add the line. Finally,
<a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html#deploying_vespa_applications">deploy</a>
your application to make the new settings apply.
