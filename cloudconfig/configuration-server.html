<p>
The Cloud Config System can be set up with one or more configuration
servers (config servers). 
A config server uses <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a> as a
distributed data storage for the configuration system. In addition,
each node runs a config proxy to cache configuration data.
</p>



<h1 id="requirements">System requirements</h1>
<p>
The default heap size for the JVM it runs
under is 1.5 Gb (which can be changed with a <a
 href="../performance/jvm-tuning.html#tune-config">setting</a>).
It writes a transaction log that is regularly purged of old
items, so little disk space is required. Note that running
on a server that has a lot of disk I/O will adversely effect
performance and is not recommended.
</p>



<h1 id="zookeeper">ZooKeeper</h1>
<p>
ZooKeeper handles data consistency across multiple config
servers. The config server Java application runs a ZooKeeper server,
embedded with an RPC frontend that the other nodes
use. ZooKeeper stores data internally in <em>nodes</em> that can have
<em>sub-nodes</em>, similiar to a file system. The path to a node can be
written out the same way as a file: <em>/vespa/config/apps</em>
</p><p>
When you start/restart the config server, the configuration file for
ZooKeeper, <em>$VESPA_HOME/conf/zookeeper/zookeeper.cfg</em>, is
generated based on the contents of
<a href="../setting-vespa-variables.html">VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</a>. Hence,
config server(s) must all be restarted if that changes on a config
server node.
</p><p>
When you <em>deploy</em>, your application's
files, along with global configurations, are stored in
ZooKeeper. The application data is stored
under <em>/vespa/config/apps/&lt;timestamp&gt;</em>. When you
run <em>deploy activate</em>, you set the newest application
<em>live</em> by updating the pointer
in <em>/vespa/config/liveapp</em> to refer to the active app's
timestamp. It is at that point the other nodes get
configured. If you try to run <em>deploy</em>, and the
config server(s) is not running, it will fail because ZooKeeper cannot
be reached. The same goes for <em>deploy activate</em>.
</p><p>
<em>zkls</em> and <em>zkcat</em> can be used to inspect state:
<ul>
<li><em>zkls /vespa/config/apps</em></li>
<li><em>zkcat /vespa/config/apps/1225109763380/userapp/services.xml</em></li>
</ul>
Note that <em>zkls /vespa/config/apps/</em> (with a trailing
slash) does not work.
</p> 


<h2 id="fault-tolerance">ZooKeeper Logs</h2>
<p>
The ZooKeeper server logs to <em>$VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa/zookeeper.configserver.log</em>
</p> 


<h2 id="fault-tolerance">Fault Tolerance</h2>
<p>
For the system to tolerate <em>n</em> failures, ZooKeeper by design
requires that you use <em>(2*n)+1</em> nodes. Consequently, only odd
numbers of nodes works. One need at least 3 nodes to have a
fault tolerant config system.
</p><p>
It is important to remember that even when using one config server,
the config system will not fail at once if that server fails. This is because
all nodes runs a <em>config proxy</em> that caches every
known config, and serves it to the components on that node. However,
restarting a node, with half or more config servers unavailable,
will lead to a failure of that node, since restarting a node means
restarting the config proxy.
</p>  


<h1 id="using-multiple-servers">Using More than one Config Server</h1>
<p>
The config servers need to be defined in <em>services.xml</em>:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;admin version="2.0"&gt;
  &lt;configservers&gt;
    &lt;configserver hostalias="administration0" /&gt;
    &lt;configserver hostalias="administration1" /&gt;
    &lt;configserver hostalias="administration2" /&gt;
  &lt;/configservers&gt;
&lt;/admin&gt;
</pre>
<p>
See the <a href="../reference/services-admin.html#configservers">admin
model</a> reference for more information. In addition,
<em>VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</em> must be set on all
nodes. This is a comma or whitespace-separated list with the hostname
of all configservers, like <em>myhost1.mydomain.com,myhost2.mydomain.com,myhost3.mydomain.com</em>.
</p><p>
When there are multiple config servers, the config clients (usually
the config proxy, if you have not configured the client to use another
config source) will pick a config server based on a hash of their
hostname and how many config servers there are. This uniformly
loads the config servers. The config clients are
fault-tolerant and will switch to another config server if it is
unavailable or there is an error in the configuration it
receives. With only one config server configured, it will continue
using that in case of errors.
</p>



<h1 id="tools">Tools to Query the Configuration System</h1>
<p>
You can log into a node to query the config server or config proxy
running on the node, using <em>getvespaconfig</em> or
<em>configproxy-cmd</em>. Alternatively, you can use the
<a href="../config-rest.html">REST API for listing and retrieving config</a>.
</p><p>
A config server or proxy can be queried for configuration data
using <em>getvespaconfig</em>. Configuration is addressed using
name and configId. If you omit configId, the global and default
data for that name is returned. The default port number is
the config proxy's port: 19090. If you use port 19070, it will query a
server instead.
</p><p>
A config proxy can be queried for status
using <em>configproxy-cmd</em>. Run it without arguments to see
usage. The tool allows you to display heap usage for the proxy,
display the configs cached and flush the cache. Also, it allows you to
view the outstanding requests it has against the server(s). An
outstanding request is the same as a subscription of server data, the
requests are held open until the data changes on the server, through
a <em>deploy activate</em>.
</p>


<h2 id="config-sources">Specifying config sources for an application</h2>
<p>
If you need to access config from a node not running the config system (e.g. doing
feeding via the Document API) or you for some other reason want to
override the default settings, this can be done
using VESPA_CONFIG_SOURCES:
</p>
<pre>
$ export VESPA_CONFIG_SOURCES="myadmin0.mydomain.com:12345,myadmin1.mydomain.com:12345"
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, for Java programs, you can use the system
property <em>configsources</em> and set it programmatically or on
the command line with the <em>-D</em> option to Java.  The syntax
for the value is the same as for the environment variable
VESPA_CONFIG_SOURCES.
