/**
 * Calculates various timeouts associated with a REST call from the Orchestrator to the Cluster Controller.
 *
 * <p>Timeout handling of HTTP messaging is fundamentally flawed in various Java implementations.
 * We would like to specify a max time for the whole operation (connect, send request, and receive response).
 * Jersey JAX-RS implementation and the Apache HTTP client library provides a way to set the connect timeout C
 * and read timeout R. So if the operation takes NR reads, and the writes takes TW time,
 * the theoretical max time is: T = C + R * NR + TW. With both NR and TW unknown, there's no way to
 * set a proper C and R.</p>
 *
 * <p>The various timeouts is set according to the following considerations:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Some time is reserved for the execution in this process, e.g. execution leading to the REST call,
 *     handling of the response, exception handling, etc, such that we can finish processing this request
 *     before the {@link #timeBudget} deadline. This is typically in the order of ms.</li>
 *     <li>A timeout will be passed to the Cluster Controller backend. We'll give a timeout such that if one
 *     CC times out, the next CC will be given exactly the same timeout. This may or may not be a good strategy:
 *     (A) There's typically a 3rd CC. But if the first 2 fails with timeout, the chance the last is OK
 *     is negligible. (B) If picking the CC is random, then giving the full timeout to the first
 *     should be sufficient since a later retry will hit the healthy CC. (C) Because we have been using
 *     DROP in networking rules, clients may time out (host out of app or whatever). This would suggest
 *     allowing more than 1 full request.</li>
 *     <li>The timeout passed to the CC backend should be such that if it honors that, the Orchestrator
 *     should not time out. This means some kernel and network overhead should be subtracted from the timeout
 *     passed to the CC.</li>
 *     <li>We're only able to set the connect and read/write timeouts(!) Since we're communicating within
 *     data center, assume connections are in the order of ms, while a single read may stall close up to the CC
 *     timeout.</li>
 * </ol>
