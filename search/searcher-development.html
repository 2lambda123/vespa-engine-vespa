The <em>Search Container</em> is the home for all global processing of
user actions (represented as queries) and their results. It provides a
development and hosting environment for
processing <em>components</em>, and a model for composing such
components developed by multiple development teams into a functional
whole.
</p>

<p>
This document describes how to develop and deploy Searcher
components. To get started with development with the container,
see <a href="../jdisc/developing-applications.html">Container developing</a>. For reference, see
the <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/search/package-summary.html">Search Container Javadoc</a>,
and <a href="../reference/services-jdisc.html#sec-3.1">services.xml
syntax reference</a>.
</p>



<h1 id="searchers">Searchers</h1>
<p>
The components of the search container are
called <em>Searchers</em>. A searcher is a component - usually
deployed as part of an OSGi bundle - which extends the
class <code>com.yahoo.search.Searcher</code>. All Searchers must
implement a single method:
</p>

<pre class="code">
public Result search(Query query, Execution execution);
</pre>

<p>
When the container receives a request, it will create a Query
representing it and execute a configured list of such Searcher
components.  This is done by calling the <code>search()</code> method
on the first searcher in the list. That searcher is responsible for
passing the call to the next searcher in the list (or not, as it sees
fit). This is done by calling <code>search()</code> on the Executor
given, which keeps track of where we are in the list of Searchers.
Hence, this is a noop searcher implementation:
</p>

<pre class="code">
public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
    return execution.search(query);
}
</pre>

<p>
Eventually the search call will reach the end of the list of
searchers. The last searcher in the list may create a Result
(somehow), which is now passed back up the call chain until it reaches
the top. The container will then translate that Result back to a
response to the incoming request.
</p>

<p>
As is evident from this description, this is a synchronous model,
where each request is processed in a dedicated worker thread until the
result is returned.  This synchronous model is implemented
with <a href="#keeping_state_in_searchers">multi-threading of
individual searchers</a>.
</p>

<p>
The single searcher method is sufficient to express all kinds of
functionality, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>query processor</em> will modify the query, then pass it on
    to the next searcher.</li>
<li>A <em>result processor</em> will pass the query on to get the
    result, then modify the result before returning it.</li>
<li>A <em>result producer</em> which produces a result by some
    internal lookup or (more typically) by sending a network request
    to a backend will translate the query to the desired execution and
    instantiate and return a Result holding the outcome.</li>
<li>A <em>workflow</em> might pass the query on multiple times in a
    loop and gradually build up a Result for return from the Results
    received from each Query execution, or choose to pass a particular
    Query in an if-else loop etc.</li>
</ul>



<h1 id="queries_and_results">Queries and Results</h1>
<p>
The <strong>Query</strong> in the search container is the container of all the
information needed to create a result to the request, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The parameters received in the request, including the user's query
    string, or chosen action.</li>
<li>The parameters in the chosen <a href="../query-profiles.html">query
    profile</a>, if any.</li>
<li>The desired execution, including the boolean query tree. This
    information is gradually created from the request and query
    profile by Searcher components.</li>
<li>Any objects of any type containing information created by
    Searchers along the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <strong>Result</strong> encapsulates all the data generated from a
Query. The Result contains a composite tree of Hit objects organized
in lists called HitGroups (the Result points to the topmost
group). Each Hit contains some particular data item which is deemed
relevant to the Query. The Hit objects has a general key-value
storage, but are also polymorphic to support representing more
structured information.
See the <a href="../reference/inspecting-structured-data.html"> inspecting
structured data</a> documentation for details about handling structured
information in a Searcher.
</p>

<p>
As Hits may be hierarchically organized into hit lists, the Result
object is capable of representing any organization of the results. For
example, in a federated system the hits are initially organized in one
hit group per source.  Upstream searchers may reorganize this into
something that fits the user's need better, e.g a single blended
group, or one group per likely interpretation of the query etc.
</p>



<h1 id="search_chains">Search Chains</h1>
<p>
The lists of searchers mentioned above are called <em>search
chains</em>.  Search chains are a special case of
the <a href="../jdisc/chained-components.html"> general component chains</a>. A
search chain is nothing more than a list of searcher instances having
an id. The search chains are typically not created for every query but
are part of the configuration. Multiple ones may exist at the same
time, the chain to execute may be specified in the request. If nothing
is specified, a default one is used. The same Searcher instance may
exist in multiple search chains, which is why the Execution object is
responsible for knowing the next Searcher to invoke in a particular
request.
</p>

<p>
Search chains may also be executed programmatically (typically from a
Searcher), either synchronously or asynchronously:
</p>

<pre class="code">
// Get a chain by id
SearchChain myChain = execution.searchChainRegistry().getComponent("myChain");

// Execute it in the same thread
Result result = new Execution(myChain, execution.context()).search(query);

// &hellip; or in another thread
Execution settings = new Execution(myChain, execution.context());
FutureResult futureResult = new AsyncExecution(settings).search(query);
FutureResult otherFutureResult = new AsyncExecution(settings).search(otherQuery);
</pre>

<p>
Asynchronous execution is useful in cases
like <a href="../federation-platform.html">federation</a>, where a
searcher forks a Query to multiple search chains in parallel, each
getting results from a particular source. Also, as in the example, it
is allowed to use the same Execution instance to construct multiple
AsyncExecution instances, as the state is only copied from the
constructor argument.
</p>

<p>
The execution order of the searchers in a chain are not ordered
explicitly, but by <a href="../jdisc/chained-components.html">ordering
constraints</a> declared in the searchers or their configuration.
</p>

<p>
For an explanation on how to configure search chains, see
the <a href="../configuring-search-chains.html">search chain
documentation</a>.
</p>



<h1 id="getting_started_with_searcher_development">Getting Started</h1>
<h2 id="setting_up_the_ide">Bootstrapping the IDE</h2>
<p>
When working on some non-trivial Searcher component, most developers
prefer to work in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse rather than testing
by direct deployment due to the improved efficiency it brings.
</p>


<h2 id="writing_a_searcher">Writing a Searcher</h2>
<p>
Here is an example of a complete searcher:
</p>

<pre class="code">
package com.yahoo.search.example;

import com.yahoo.search.*;
import com.yahoo.search.result.Hit;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.Execution;

/**
 * A searcher adding a new hit.
 *
 * @author  Joe Developer
 * @version $Id$
 */
public class SimpleSearcher extends Searcher {

    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        Result result = execution.search(query); // Pass on to the next searcher to get results
        Hit hit = new Hit("test");
        hit.setField("message", "Hello world");
        result.hits().add(hit);
        return result;
    }

}
</pre>

<p>
In production, the container will create one or more instances of this
class and place it in the desired search chain(s) to serve queries, as
specified
in <a href="../jdisc/container-components.html#adding-component-to-application-package">
the configuration</a>.  The first line in this searcher forwards the
query to whatever is the next searcher in the chain this is a part
of. This will eventually produce a Result, which is modified and then
passed back to the previous searcher in this chain. The container will
create a new instance of this searcher only when it is reconfigured,
so any data needed by the searcher can be read and prepared from a
constructor in the searcher. Constructors may also
accept <a href="../jdisc/container-components.html#configurable_components">configuration</a>,
as any other pluggable component.
</p>

<p>
You can see the full API available to searchers at
the <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/search/package-summary.html">Search Container
Javadoc</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="testing_a_searcher">Testing a Searcher</h2>
<p>
Before there is any point in testing a searcher in a real system, it
should pass a set of unit tests which test it in isolation or together
with the few searchers it interacts with. To do this, we can write
unit tests which programmatically sets up a search chain containing
the searcher to be tested, the searchers it interacts with (if any)
and a searcher which produces mock results appropriate for the
tests. Here is a simple example testing the Searcher above:
</p>

<pre class="code">
package com.yahoo.search.example.test;

import com.yahoo.search.*;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.*;
import com.yahoo.search.example.SimpleSearcher;

public class SimpleSearcherTestCase extends junit.framework.TestCase {

    public void testBasics() {
        // Create chain
        Chain&lt;Searcher&gt; searchChain = new Chain&lt;Searcher&gt;(new SimpleSearcher());

        // Create an empty context, in a running container this would be
        // populated with settings used by different searcher. Tests must
        // set this according to their own requirements.
        Execution.Context context = Execution.Context.createContextStub(null);
        Execution execution = new Execution(searchChain, context);

        // Execute it
        Result result = execution.search(new Query("search/?query=some test query"));

        // Assert the result has the expected hit by scanning for the ID
        assertNotNull(result.hits().get("test"));
    }

}
</pre>

<p>
In this case, no searcher producing mock results is needed because the
searcher we are testing does not care what the Result contains.  If
the search chain ends with a searcher which produces no result the
framework will simply return an empty result, which is what happens in
this case. A test adding a mock searcher producing results are shown
in
the <a href="../federation-platform.html#unit_testing_the_result_processor">federation
document</a>.
</p>

<p>
To write unit tests of the whole application package, see
<a href="../jdisc/developing-applications.html#unit-test">unit testing</a> under application development.
</p>


<h2 id="deploying_a_searcher">Deploying a Searcher</h2>
<p>
Once the searcher passes unit tests, it can be deployed to the Vespa
system which will host it. The procedure is the same as described
in <a href="../jdisc/container-components.html#deploying_a_searcher">deploying
a component</a>. First you have to <a href=
"../jdisc/container-components.html#building_the_plugin_jar">build the
component jar file</a>. To include the searcher
in <em>services.xml</em>, you need to define a search chain and add
the searcher to it.  This is a complete <em>services.xml</em> doing
this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;admin version="2.0"&gt;
      &lt;adminserver hostalias="node1" /&gt;
    &lt;/admin&gt;

    &lt;jdisc version="1.0"&gt;
        &lt;search&gt;
          &lt;chain id="default" inherits="vespa"&gt;
            &lt;searcher id="com.yahoo.search.example.SimpleSearcher" /&gt;
          &lt;/chain&gt;
        &lt;/search&gt;
        &lt;nodes&gt;
          &lt;node hostalias="node1" /&gt;
        &lt;/nodes&gt;
    &lt;/jdisc&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In this case, we are defining the search chain <code>default</code>,
which will be used in queries when no other chain is explicitly
specified.
</p>

<p>
The searcher id above is resolved to the component bundle jar we added
by the symbolic name in the manifest, and to the right class within
the bundle by the class name. By keeping all these three the same, we
keep things simple, but more advanced use where this is possible is
also supported. This will be explained in later sections.
</p>

<p>
For a reference to these tags,
see <a href="../reference/services-jdisc.html#sec-3.1">the
jdisc services section reference</a>.
</p>

<p>
An accompanying <em>hosts.xml</em> to the
above <em>services.xml</em> may simply be
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;hosts&gt;
  &lt;host name="localhost"&gt;
    &lt;alias&gt;node1&lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;/host&gt;
&lt;/hosts&gt;
</pre>

<p>
By creating a directory containing this <em>services.xml</em>,
<em>hosts.xml</em> and <em>components/Simplesearcher.jar</em>,
that directory becomes a complete application package containing a
bundle, which can now be deployed to a Vespa instance.
</p>

<h3 id="querying_the_instance">Querying the Instance</h3>
<p>
We can now attempt to query the application by
doing <a href="http://localhost:8080/search/?query=best">http://localhost:8080/search?query=best</a>. This
should return a JSON result.
</p>

<h2 id="testing-searchers-with-application">Testing a Searcher with an Application</h2>
<p>
A searcher can also be tested running inside a container.
We create a JDisc from the container part of the <em>services.xml</em> file above:
</p>

<pre class="code">
import com.yahoo.component.ComponentSpecification;
import com.yahoo.application.container.JDisc;
import com.yahoo.application.Networking;

import com.yahoo.search.Query;
import com.yahoo.search.Result;

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;

public class ContainerTest {
    @Test
    public void testSearch() {
        String servicesXml =
                "&lt;jdisc version=\"1.0\"&gt;" +
                "  &lt;search&gt;" +
                "    &lt;chain id=\"default\" inherits=\"vespa\"&gt;" +
                "      &lt;searcher id=\"com.yahoo.search.example.SimpleSearcher\" /&gt;" +
                "    &lt;/chain&gt;" +
                "  &lt;/search&gt;" +
                "&lt;/jdisc&gt;";
        try (JDisc container = JDisc.fromServicesXml(servicesXml, Networking.disabled)) {
            Result result = container.search().process(ComponentSpecification.fromString("default"), new Query("search/?query=test+query"));
            assertNotNull(result.hits().get("test"));
        }

    }
}
</pre>

<p>
We can also examine which searchers are in a chain and their ordering:
</p>
<pre class="code">
ChainRegistry<Searcher> chains = container.searching().getChains();
Chain<Searcher> defaultChain = chains.getComponent("default");

boolean foundSimpleSearcher = false;
for (Searcher searcher: defaultChain.components()) {
    if ("com.yahoo.search.example.SimpleSearcher".equals(searcher.getClassName()))
        foundSimpleSearcher = true;
}

assertTrue("No instance of SimpleSearcher found in the default chain", foundSimpleSearcher);
</pre>

<h1 id="more_on_searcher_development">More on Searcher Development</h1>
<h2 id="passing_information_between_searchers">Passing Information Between Searchers</h2>
<p>
The query object is used to pass information between searchers. A part
of the query is a general property store which may hold any
object. Any values set in the request or in the query profile is
available through these properties, but in addition searchers may add
any objects they create. This is useful when some searcher component
is producing information later consumed by some other. Here is an
example:
</p>

<pre class="code">
import com.yahoo.search.*;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.*;

@Provides(SomeObject.NAME)
public class ProducerSearcher extends Searcher {

    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        SomeObject.setTo(query.properties(), new SomeObject(query));
        return execution.search(query); // Pass to next in chain
    }
}
</pre>

<pre class="code">
import com.yahoo.search.*;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.*;

@After(SomeObject.NAME)
public class ConsumerSearcher extends Searcher {

    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        SomeObject someObject = SomeObject.getFrom(query.properties());
        &hellip;
        return execution.search(query); // Pass to next in chain
    }
}
</pre>

<pre class="code">
import com.yahoo.search.query.Properties;

public final class SomeObject {
    public static final String NAME = "SomeObject";

    public static void setTo(Properties properties, SomeObject value) {
        properties.set(NAME, value);
    }

    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static SomeObject getFrom(Properties properties) {
        return (SomeObject) properties.get(NAME);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
This code illustrates two idioms such searchers should follow when
exchanging data:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The key to an object should be exactly the same as the short name
    of the object stored.</li>
<li>The searcher should declare that it <em>provides</em> exactly the
    same name (and of course the consumers must declare that they need
    to be <em>after</em> the object is provided).</li>
</ul>

<p>
When it does not cause unwanted dependencies, it is recommended to
wrap the property get and put in a (static)
<code>getFrom</code> and <code>setTo</code> method in the stored
object to allow storage and lookup without having to mention the key
unnecessarily outside the object.
</p>

<p>
Note that the objects are passed as regular in-memory references so
there is no noticeable overhead in this.  However, in some situations
(like when federating to multiple sources) the query will need to be
cloned.  The query will then attempt to clone the added
properties. Those that implement Cloneable will have clone called, the
rest will be copied by reference. It is very important that objects
added to the query which contains mutable state is deep cloned to
avoid nasty bugs. On the other hand, cloning objects which should not
change is wasteful, they should be copied by reference. Hence, the
guidelines are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Objects which should not be modified downstream should enforce
    immutability when added to the Query, either by not offering any
    mutator methods, or by being <em>frozen</em> (in a state where any
    mutator call causes an exception). Objects which <em>enforces</em>
    mutability should either not implement Cloneable or should
    implement a shallow clone.</li>
<li>Objects which should support downstream modifications <strong>must</strong>
    implement Cloneable and offer a clone method which performs deep
    copying.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="query-context">The Query Context</h3>
<p>
In some cases there is a need for passing information between
searchers beyond those who see the same Query object.  For this
purpose, the Query provides a QueryContext object which provides a
shared data view to all Searchers working on the same request. The
context provides (among other things) a facility for setting
properties (named objects).  The context can be accessed safely from
all the threads working on a request without incurring synchronization
overhead (with some caveats), but provides linear, not constant lookup
time. To set and retrieve such properties, use
</p>

<pre class="code">
{query|result}.getContext(true).setProperty(name, value)
{query|result}.getContext(true).getProperty(name)
</pre>

<h2 id="parametrizing_searchers">Parametrizing Searchers</h2>
<p>
It is easy to pass arguments to searchers&mdash;any key-value looked
up in the query properties in the searcher may be passed as is in the
request, or in a query profile: If the searcher does e.g.:
</p>

<pre class="code">
String myParameter = query.properties().getString("my.parameter", "defaultValue");
</pre>

<p>
This value may be set by adding <code>&amp;my.parameter=myValue</code>
to the request.
</p>

<p>There are some guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Names should use camelCase with the first letter in small
    caps</li>
<li>Dots are used for nesting and have a special meaning
    in <a href="../query-profiles.html">query profiles</a>. They exist to
    aid organization of the space of parameters, which easily grows
    quite large. Usually, the right thing to do is to create a
    separate name space for each searcher&mdash;i.e use the same
    dotted prefix for all parameters, as
    in <code>myfeature.a</code>, <code>myfeature.b</code> etc. In
    addition to helping keep the search API clean, this allows various
    query profiles containing settings for all values in
    <code>myfeature</code> to be defined and selected at run time,
    which is often useful.</li>
<li>To make such parameter APIs easier to use, one should also
    consider creating a
    <a href="../query-profiles.html#query_profile_types">query profile
    type</a> defining the legal parameters. This will be in the form
    of an XML file accompanying the bundle. This allows checking and
    optionally enforcement of validity of request parameter and query
    profile settings of the parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Parameters should be used for all query state which it is reasonable
and just as cheap to assume may change with every query. Good
candidates are e.g numerical values to algorithms and switches to
business logic.
</p>


<h2 id="execution_model">Search Container Execution Model</h2>
<p>
In broad strokes, the Search Middleware Container works like this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The main thread picks up one of the requests waiting in the queue
    of the input socket</li>
<li>This thread selects the search chain to be used to answer this
    request, and hands off the actual execution of the chain to a
    worker thread (there are many such worker threads)</li>
<li>The worker thread calls all searchers in the search chain in turn,
    starting with the first one</li>
<li>Each searcher returns results</li>
<li>Results are eventually rendered (maybe using a template) into the
    buffer of the output socket</li>
</ol>

<p>
There is a single instance of each search chain. In every chain, there
is a single instance of each searcher.  (Unless a chain is configured
with multiple, identical searchers&mdash;this is a rare case.)
</p>

<p>
When simultaneous requests arrive for the same search chain, multiple
worker threads execute the searchers in that chain. A searcher can
therefore be executed concurrently by multiple threads; many threads
of execution can be going through the <code>search()</code> method,
concurrently.
</p>

<p>
This model places a very important constraint on searcher classes:
<em>instance variables are not safe.</em> They must be eliminated, or
made thread-safe somehow.
</p>


<h2 id="keeping_state_in_searchers">Keeping State in Searchers</h2>
<p>
As the passing of queries and results happen on the call stack, the
container will allocate many worker threads to execute queries, using
one thread per query until the result is returned.
</p>

<p>
This means that any state we wish to keep along in the searcher for
this particular query until the result is returned should be kept as
local variables in the search method, while state which should be
shared by all queries should be kept as member variables. As the
latter kind will be accessed by multiple threads at any one time, the
state of such member variables must be <em>multithread safe</em>.
</p>

<p>
This critical restriction is similar to those of e.g. the Servlet
API. A quick example should drive the point home:
</p>

<pre class="code">
public class SafeSearcher extends Searcher {

    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        long count = (Long) query.properties().get("Count");
        count++;
        return execution.search(query);
    }
}

public class UnsafeSearcher extends Searcher {
    private long count;

    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        count = (Long) query.properties().get("Count");
        count++; // <strong>unsafe</strong>
        return execution.search(query);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
The second example uses an instance variable, which will be accessed
concurrently by multiple threads. Without proper concurrency controls
(such as synchronization), such access is inherently unsafe and may
yield inconsistent results, and/or data corruption.
</p>

<p>
You have a limited number of options when implementing a
multithread-safe searcher with instance variables:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Use immutable objects: they never change after they are
    constructed; no modifications to their state occurs after the
    Searcher constructor returns.</li>
<li>Use a single instance of a thread-safe class.</li>
<li>Create a single instance and synchronize access to it across all
    threads (but this will severely limit your scalability).</li>
<li>Arrange for each thread to have its own instance, e.g. with
    a <code>ThreadLocal</code>.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="multiphase_searching">Multiphase Searching</h2>
<p>
The model of a single pass fetching results from a Query described in
this document is sometimes too simplistic to produce good
performance. The search container supports <em>multiphase
searching</em> to address such cases. With multiphase searching the
hits of the result is first filled with some minimal information. This
minimally filled result is sent up the search chain where some of the
hits are hopefully removed. When more information is needed, a second
fill request is sent down the search chain to fetch more data for just
those hits remaining in the result. This may happen in repeated stages
working on progressively smaller sets of hits containing progressively
more expensive information.
</p>

<p>
The container supports this by offering <code>fill</code> methods on
execution which may be called to request more information added to the
hits of the result from a searcher. In addition, the backends and
backend providers must support multiphase searching (this is currently
only the case for internal Vespa clusters).
</p>

<p>
Any searchers should assume they are operating in a multi-phase
setup. This means:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Searchers which changes the query or contain workflows do not need
    to do anything</li>
<li>Searchers which accesses field information (not just id and
    relevance) from hits should <strong>always</strong> call
    either <code>fill()</code> to get the default set of fields for
    each hit type or <code>fill(summaryClassName)</code> to get a
    particular collection of fields known to exist in the backend(s)
    in question. Calling fill on a result which contains
    already-filled hits is very cheap.</li>
<li>Federating searchers should implement both the
    regular <code>search</code> method and the <code>fill</code>
    method. The fill method must request filling down the source
    branches which has remaining hits in the result.</li>
<li>Backend searchers which wish to support multiphase searching
    should initially deliver unfilled hits and implement
    a <code>fill</code> method which fills the hits in the given
    result belonging to that backend with information from the
    backend.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your searcher encounters a problem and wants to signal an error,
you can set an error hit in the result object, by
calling <code>result.hits().addError(errorMsg)</code>.
