<h1>Container component types</h1>

<p class="ingress">
  The container has a large number of different types of plug-ins available
  to a developer, this is an outline of when and why to use the different
  kinds. To start creating components, see
  <a href="../jdisc/developing-applications.html">developing applications</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="overview">30000 feet perspective</h2>

<img src="../img/container_components.svg">

<p>
  Starting at the top of the diagram, <a href="#server">server</a> instances are
  used for supporting external clients (if no suitable implementations of
  com.yahoo.jdisc.service.ServerProvider are available. A client may or may not
  be a network client, so it is related to the network layer. The network layer
  associates a Request with a <a href="#responsehandler">response handler</a>
  and routes it to the correct type of <a href="#requesthandler">request
  handler</a> (typically based on URI binding patterns).
</p>

<p>
  If an application needs lightweight request-response processing using
  decomposition by a series of chained logical units, the <a href="../jdisc/processing.html">processing framework</a>
  is the correct family of components to use. The request will be routed from
  ProcessingHandler through one or more chains of <a
  href="#processor">Processor</a> instances. The exact format of the output is
  customizable using a <a href="#renderer">Renderer</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If doing search queries, SearchHandler will create a Query object, route that
  to the pertinent chain of <a href="#searcher">Searcher</a> instances, and
  associate the returned Result with the correct <a href="#renderer">Renderer</a>
  instance for optional customization of the output format.
</p>

<p>
  The DocumentProcessingHandler is usually invoked from messagebus, and used for
  feeding documents into an index or storage. The incoming data is used to build
  a Document object, and this is then feed through a chain of <a
  href="#docproc">DocumentProcessor</a> instances.
</p>

<p>
  If building an application with custom HTTP APIs, for instance arbitrary REST
  APIs, the easiest way is building a custom <a
  href="#requesthandler">RequestHandler</a>. This gets the Request, which is
  basically a set of key-value pairs, and returns a stream of arbitrary data
  back to the network.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="#component">Component</a> is the basic building block in the
  container. A component may be injected into other components, including all
  the different request handlers, document processors and so on mentioned above,
  and will get a destructor like method invoked when no other component is using
  it any more.
</p>


<h2 id="server">Server</h2>
<p>
  Servers are components implementing the com.yahoo.jdisc.service.ServerProvider
  interface, usually by subclassing
  com.yahoo.jdisc.service.AbstractServerProvider. Use this if developing support
  for a new type of clients, e.g. an unsupported network protocol.
</ul>

<h2 id="responsehandler">Response handlers</h2>

<p>
  Response handlers are invoked by the request handlers after the client
  response is created. The correct response handler is chosen from URI
  pattern bindings. A Response is a more or less opaque data structure,
  so a response handler is more suited to e.g. tracking return codes
  than doing deep result inspections.
</p>

<h2 id="requesthandler">Request handlers</h2>

<p>
  Request handlers are the easiest way to implement arbitrary REST services. The
  incoming request is a set of key-value pairs and protocol specific
  information. A request handler my fire off a request to e.g. the search
  handler, but what it will get back is opaque. If context sensitive result
  transformations are necessary, the request handler must be paired with one or
  more <a href="#searcher">searchers</a>, and if the output from the search
  needs to be customized, a <a href="#renderer">renderer</a> for the search
  result is the correct way of doing it (as opposed to trying to transform the
  search response in the request handler).
</p>

<h2 id="processor">Processor instances</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="../jdisc/processing.html">processing framework</a> is to be used for light-weight solutions where
  decomposition of the problem by partitioning the implementation into
  (a) chain(s) of processors is useful. Processors are invoked synchronously
  and the response is a tree of arbitrary data elements. Custom output
  formats is achieved by adding <a href="#renderer">renderers</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="renderer">Renderers</h2>

<p>
  Renderers are result formatters for the processing and search frameworks
  in the container. They usually render responses as JSON or XML, but
  arbitrary MIME types may be used, including binary formats. Renderers
  are subclasses of com.yahoo.processing.rendering.Renderer.
</p>

<h2 id="searcher">Searchers</h2>

<p>
  Searchers are the only supported way of doing <i>structured</i> query
  and result transforms in a search context. If an application is performing
  searches and needs to look at single result documents (hits) or needs
  to add terms to the parsed query, searchers are the only way to do this
  robustly.
</p>

<h2 id="docproc">Document processors</h2>

<p>
  Document processors are for documents what searchers are for queries, they
  can access and transform documents robustly and structured. If documents
  need some kind of transformations or annotations before reaching an
  index or storage, custom document processors are usually a better solution
  than manipulating the document feed.
</p>

<h2 id="component">Components</h2>

<p>
  Usually, any container plug-in is a component. A component is usually a
  subclass of com.yahoo.component.AbstractComponent, though
  com.yahoo.component.Component is an interface. Components are the low-level
  wirings for using composition with injection in the container. If building
  complex searchers or document processors, shared resources or simply
  partitioning the code, is often needed. The Component is an object with
  a controlled lifecycle which may be injected into other components, such
  as searchers, renderers, document processors, request handlers and so on
  an so forth.
