<p>
A search application can improve the quality of the experience it
delivers by interpreting the intended meaning of the user
queries. Once the meaning is guessed, the query can be rewritten to
one that will satisfy the user better than the raw query.  Vespa
includes a query rewriting language which makes it easy to use query
rewriting to understand and act upon the semantics of queries.
</p>

<p>
Some typical tasks that can be achieved using query rewriting include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Query focusing: Decide an index to search for a term</li>
  <li>Query enhancing: Add additional terms which improves the query</li>
  <li>Stopwords: Remove terms which hurts recall or precision</li>
  <li>Synonyms: Replace terms or phrases by others</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, all these techniques can be combined to create a really
good search experience.
</p>

<p>
Query rewriting in Vespa is done by <em>semantic rules</em> or <em>searchers</em>.
Semantic rules is a simple production rule language which operates on queries.
For more complex query rewriting logic which could not be handled by simple
rules, one could create rewriting searcher making use of the query rewriting
framework.
</p>


<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>

<p>
A simple semantic rule may look like this:
</p>

<pre>
lotr -&gt; lord of the rings;
</pre>

<p>
This means that whenever the term <em>lotr</em> is encountered in
a query, replace it by the terms <em>lord of the rings</em>.
</p>

<p>
Rules can also refer to conditions, and the produced terms can be a
modified version of whatever is matched instead of a concrete
term:
</p>

<pre>
[brand] -&gt; company:[brand];
[brand] :- sony, dell, ibm, hp;
</pre>

<p>
This rule says that, whenever the condition named <em>brand</em> is
matched, replace the matched term(s) by <em>the same term(s)</em>
searching the <em>company</em> index. In addition, the
<em>brand</em> condition is defined to match any of a list of
brands. Note how <em>-></em> means a replacing production rule,
<em>:-</em> means a condition and <em>,</em> separates
alternatives.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to do grouping using parentheses, list multiple
terms which must be matched in sequence, and to write <em>adding</em>
production rules using <em>+&gt;</em> instead of
<em>-&gt;</em>. Terms are by default added using the query
default (as if they were written in the search box), but it is also
possible to force them to be AND, OR, NOT or RANK using respectively
<em>+</em>, <em>?</em>, <em>-</em> and <em>$</em>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a more complex rule illustrating this:
</p>

<pre>
[destination] (in, by, at, on) [place] +&gt; $name:[destination]
</pre>

<p>
This rule boosts matches which has a destination which matches the
<em>name</em> index followed by a preposition and a place (the
definition of the <em>destination</em> and <em>place</em>
conditions are not shown).  This is achieved by adding a RANK
term&mdash;a term which do not impact whether or not a document is
matched but which adds a relevancy boost if it is.</p>

<p>The complete syntax of this language is found in the
<a href="reference/semantic-rules.html ">semantic
rules reference</a>.
</p>



<h1 id="rule-base">Rule bases</h1>

<p>
A collection of rules used together are collected in a <em>rule
base</em>&mdash;a text file containing rules and condition and which
haves the ending <em>.sr</em>; (for semantic rules).  Here is an
example of a complete rule base:
</p>

<pre>
# Replacements
lotr -&gt; lord of the rings;
colour -&gt; color;
audi -&gt; skoda;

# Stopwords
[stopword] -&gt; ;  # (Replace them by nothing)
[stopword] :- and, or, the, be;

# Focus brands to the brand index. If we think the <em>brand</em>
# index has high quality data, we can replace.  We use the same name
# for the condition and the index, but this is not necessary.
[brand] :- brand:[brand];
[brand] :- sony, dell, ibm, hp;

# Boost recognized categories
[category] +&gt; $category:[category];
[category] :- laptop, digital camera, camera;
</pre>

<p>
The rules in a rule base is evaluated in order from the top down. A
rule will be matched as many times as is possible before evaluation
moves on to the next query. So the query <em>colour colour</em>
will be rewritten to <em>color color</em> before moving on to the
next rule.
</p>



<h1 id="configuring">Configuring a rule base in your application</h1>

<p>
A rule base file is placed in the <code>rules/</code> directory under
the application package, and will be named as the file excluding the
<em>.sr</em>. E.g. if we save the rules above
to <code>[my-application]/rules/example.sr</code>, we will have a
rules base available named <em>example</em>.
</p>

<p>
To make a rule base be used by default in queries,
add <code>@default</code> on a separate line to the rule base. To
deactivate the default rules, add <code>rules.off</code> to the
query.
</p>

<p>
The rules can safely be updated at any time by
running <code>deploy prepare</code> again. If there are errors in
the rule bases, they will not be updated, and the errors will be
reported on the command line.
</p>

<p>
To see what the rules are doing,
add <code>tracelevel.rules=[number]</code> to the query.  1-5 gives
increasingly more detailed output.
</p>



<h1 id="using-multiple">Using multiple rule bases</h1>

<p>
It is possible to place multiple rule bases under
the <code>[my-application]/rules/</code> directory and choose between
them in the query, and rules may also include each other. This is
useful to organize larger sets of rules, to experiment with variants
of the rule set in new bases which includes the standard base, or to
use different sets of rules for different use cases.
</p>

<p>
To include one rule base in another,
add <code>@include(rulebasename)</code> on a separate line, where
<em>rulebasename</em> is the file name (with or without the
<em>.sr</em>). The result will be the same as if the included
rule base were copied in to the location of the include line. If a
condition is defined in both bases, the one from the <em>including</em>
base will be used. It is also possible to refer to the same-named
condition in an included rule base using the <code>@super</code>
directive as a condition. For example, this rule base adds some more
categories to the <em>category</em> definition in
the <code>example.sr</code> above:
</p>

<pre>
@include(example)

# Category becomes laptop, digital camera, camera, palmtop, phone
[category] :- @super, palmtop, phone;
</pre>

<p>
Multiple rule bases can be included, and included rule bases can
themselves have included rule bases. All the rule bases included in
the application package will be available when making queries. One of
the rule bases can be made the default by adding <code>@default</code>
on a separate line in the rule base.  To use another rule base,
add <code>rules.rulebase=[rulebasename]</code> to the query.
</p>


<h2 id="using-fsa">Using a finite state automaton</h2>

<p>
When you want to match more than some thousand words or phrases in
conditions, it becomes suboptimal, and perhaps impractical to keep
them in a rule base. To help in such cases, it is possible to create
a <em>finite state automaton</em> which contains the definition of some
(or all) of the conditions of a rule base. Finite state automatas are
very efficient in storing and making lookups in large lists of
strings. An automata is created from a text file which lists the
condition terms to match and the condition names separated by a tab
(by default).  The name of the condition can be followed by a
semicolon and additional data which will be ignored.
</p>

<p>
This automata source file defines the same as the
<em>stopword</em> and <em>brand</em> conditions in the
example rule base:
</p>

<pre>
and   stopword
or    stopword
be    stopword
the   stopword
sony  brand
dell  brand
ibm   brand; This text is ignored
hp    brand
</pre>

<p>
If this automata is included in the example rule base, the two
conditions can be removed from the rule base file. To use the automata
instead, the automata source file must be compiled into an automata
file. The 'makefsa' executable is installed as part of Vespa:
</p>

<pre>
$ makefsa -t sourcefile.txt targetfile.fsa
</pre>

<p>
The target file is used from a rule base by
adding <em>@automata(automatafile)</em> on a separate line in the
rule base file (the file path is relative to <em>$VESPA_HOME</em>).
Automata files must be added to all QRS nodes manually.
</p>

<p>
Note that automatas are not included in others, so a rule base
including another which uses an automata must also declare to use the
same automata (or an automata containing any desired changes form the
automata of the included base).
