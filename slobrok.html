This document describes the <em>Service Location Broker (Slobrok)</em>
service in Vespa.
</p>

<p>
Slobrok is an acronym for <em>Service Location Broker</em>, and it is
a name service used in Vespa. The service listens on a specific
port. Use
the <a href="reference/vespa-model-inspect.html">Vespa
Model Inspector</a> to find out what port number
the <code>Slobrok</code> service has.
</p>

<p>
Clients (like the Document API), will try to do lookups toward any of the
nodes the service location broker is running on. The Slobrok process
looks like this: <code>ps ax|grep slobrok</code>:

<pre class="code">
93906  ??  SJ     2:31.52 $VESPA_HOME/bin/slobrok -p 19100 -c slobrok.0
</pre>

<p>
The Slobrok is running on the administration node as well as one or
two other random nodes for redundancy. As the service requires minimal
system resources, it should not disturb other services running on the
same node.
