<p class="ingress">
The <em>nativeRank</em> text match score is a reasonably good text
rank score which is computed at an acceptable performance by Vespa. It
computes a normalized rank score which tries to capture how well query
terms matched the set of searched index fields.
</p>

<p>
The <em>nativeRank</em> feature is computed as a linear combination of
three other matching
features: <em>nativeFieldMatch</em>, <em>nativeProximity</em>
and <em>nativeAttributeMatch</em>,
see <a href="reference/nativerank.html">the nativeRank
reference for details</a>. Ranking signals that might be usefull like
freshness (the age of the document compared to the time of the query)
or any other document or query features is <strong>NOT</strong> a part
of the <em>nativeRank</em> calculation and needs to be added to the
final ranking function depending on the vertical
specifics. The <em>nativeRank</em> is a pure text match ranking
function and should be used in combination with other vertical
specific features to produce the final optimal rank score.
</p>



<h1 id="ranking-expressions-and-rank-features">Ranking Expressions and nativeRank</h1>

<p>
Vespa allows the final rank score number to be calculated by a
configured mathematical expression
called <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html">ranking
expression</a>.  Ranking expressions looks like straightforward
mathematical expressions and supports the usual mathematical operators
and functions allowing the user to configure any rank function,
including usage of the <em>nativeRank</em> text matching feature.
</p>

<p>
The primitive values which are combined by ranking expressions are
called <strong>rank features</strong>.  The rank features are numbers
which say something about the query, the document or how well the
query matched this particular document. The query features can be sent
as http query parameters or set in searchers, the document features
are the attributes (indexing:attribute) specified in the search
definition, and the match features are calculated by Vespa from the
index during matching. The <em>nativeRank</em> feature is one example
of a built in match feature, which only concerns the query/document
matching. The final rank score should also utilize other signals that
are vertical specific, for instance document age (freshness), quality
of the document (number of inlinks in a web context, maybe ratings and
reviews in social applications) and user personalization (user age,
gender etc). See
the <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank feature
list</a> for details about built-in rank-features in Vespa.
</p>



<h1 id="demo">Using nativeRank</h1>

<p>
In this section we describe a blog search application that
uses <em>nativeRank</em> as the core text matching rank feature, in
combination with other signals that could be important for a blog
search type of application.
</p>

<pre class="brush: sd">
search blog {
  document blog {
    field title type string {
      indexing: summary | index
    }
    field body type string {
      indexing: summary | index
    }
    #The quality of the source in the range 0 - 1.0
    field sourcequality type float {
      indexing: summary | attribute
    }
    #seconds since epoch
    field timestamp type long {
      indexing: summary | attribute
    }
    field url type uri {
      indexing: summary
    }
  }
  fieldset default {
    fields: title, body
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
In addition to the core text match feature (<em>nativeRank</em>) we
have a pre-calculated document feature which indicates the quality of
the document represented by the field sourcequality of type float. The
sourcequality field has
the <a href="reference/search-definitions.html#attribute">attribute</a>
property which is required to refer that field in a ranking
expression: <em>attribute(name)</em>. The sourcequality score could be
calculated from webmap, or any other source and is outside the scope
of this document. We also know when the documented was published
(timestamp) and this document attribute can be used to calculate the
age of the document. To summarize we have three main rank signals that
we would like our blog ranking function to consist of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>How well the query match the document text, where we use
    the <em>nativeRank</em> feature score</li>
<li>How fresh the document is, where we use the
    built-in <em>age(name)</em> feature to built our own feature
    score</li>
<li>The quality of the document, calculated outside of Vespa and
    referenced in a ranking expression
    by <em>attribute(name)</em></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="native-tuning">Tuning nativeRank</h1>
<p>
We tune the index field weight in the rank-profile, this is done by
the <a href="reference/search-definitions.html#weight">field
weight</a> configuration parameter. We claim that a hit in the title
is more relevant then a hit in the body so we have configured a weight
of 200 for the title, and 100 (default) for the body. There are
several other <a href="reference/nativerank.html">tuning
parameters of the nativeRank feature</a>, like:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The weight of the 3 nativeRank components that nativeRank consist
    of: nativeFieldMatch, nativeProximity and
    nativeAttributeMatch</li>
<li>The shape the boosting tables for core statistics like term
    frequency and proximity between terms in the field.</li>
<li>Per field configuration supported, can have different term
    frequency boosting (or any other of the core statistics) for text
    with different characteristics, e.g title compared to body</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="reference/nativerank.html#configuration-properties">See
the comprehensive list of all the configuration properties of
nativeRank</a>.
</p>



<h1 id="demo-freshness">Designing Our Own Blog Freshness Ranking Function</h1>

<p>
Vespa has
several <a href="reference/rank-features.html">built in
rank-features</a> that we can use directly or we can design our own as
well if the built in features doesn't meet our requirements. The built
in <em>freshness(name)</em> rank-feature is linearly decreasing from 0
age (now) to the configured max age. Ideally we would like to have a
different shape for our blog application, we define the followign
feature which has the characteristic we want
</p>

<pre class="brush: sd">
    macro freshness() {
      expression: exp(-1 * age(timestamp)/(3600*12))
    }
</pre>

<p>
Our timestamp resolution is seconds, so we divide by 3600 to go to an
hour resolution an further we divide with 12 to control the slope of
the freshness function. Below is a plot of two freshness functions
with different slope numbers for comparision.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/relevance/blog-freshness.png" />
</figure>

<p>
The beauty is that we can control and experiment with the freshness
rank score given the document age. We can define any shape over any
resolution that we think will fit the exact vertical requirements. In
our case we would like to have a none-linear relationship between the
age of the document and the freshness score. We achieve this with a
exponential decreasing function (exp(-x)), where the sensivity of x is
higher when the document is really fresh compared to a old blog post
(24 hours).
</p>



<h1 id="demo-expression">Putting Our Features Together Into a Ranking
Expression</h1>

<p>
We now need to put our three main ranking signals together into one
ranking expression. We would like to control the weight of each
component at query time so we can at query time do analysis to figure
out if a certain signal should be weighted more then others. We chose
to combine our three signals into a normalized weighted sum of the
three signals. The shape of each of the three signals might be tuned
individually as we have seen with design of our own freshness feature
and <em>nativeRank</em> tuning. Below is the final blog rank-profile
with all relevant settings (properties) and ranking expressions.
</p>

<pre class="brush: sd">
rank-profile blog inherits default {
    weight title: 200
    weight body: 100
    rank-properties {
      $textMatchWeight: 0.4 #pre-configured weigths, can be overriden at query time
      $qualityWeigth: 0.3
      $deservesFreshness: 0.3
      nativeFieldMatch.occurrenceCountTable.title: &quot;linear(0,1)&quot; #Example of nativeRank tuning, override the occurrence boost shape to be flat
    }

    #our freshness rank feature
    macro freshness() {
      expression: exp(-1 * age(timestamp)/(3600*12))
    }

    #our quality rank feature
    macro quality() {
      expression: attribute(sourcequality)

    #normalization factor for the weighted sum
    macro normalization() {
      expression: $textMatchWeight + $qualityWeight + $deservesFreshness
    }

    #ranking function that runs over all matched documents, determined by the boolean query logic
    first-phase {
      expression: (query(textMatchWeight) * (nativeRank(title,body) + query(qualityWeight) * quality +  query(deservesFreshness) * freshness))/normalization
    }

    summary-features: nativeRank(title,body) age(date) rankingExpression(freshness@) rankingExpression(quality@)
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
We can override the weight of each signal at query time with
the <a href="reference/search-api.html">search api</a>,
passing down the weights to the search core by:
</p>

<pre class="code">
/search/?query=vespa+ranking&amp;datetime=now&amp;iranking.profile=blog&amp;ranking.features.query(textMatchWeight)=0.1&amp;ranking.features.query(deservesFreshness)=0.85
</pre>

<p>
It is also possible to override these user defined rank-features in a
custom qrs searcher plugin, note that we also use
the <em>datetime</em> parameter to be able to calculate the age of the
document.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="reference/search-definitions.html#summaryfeatures">summary-features</a>
allows us to have access to the individual ranking signals along with
the hit's summary fields.
</p>



<h1 id="demo-tiering">An alternative approach with tiering</h1>

<p>
After some research we figured that we would like to have a tiered
ranking function, where the freshness signal is only applied to
documents that are from thrustworthy blog sites. A suggested approach
is given below:
</p>

<pre class="code">
rank-profile blog inherits default {
    weight title: 200
    weight body: 100
    rank-properties {
      $textMatchWeight: 0.4 #pre-configured weigths, can be overriden at query time
      $qualityWeigth: 0.3
      $deservesFreshness: 0.3
      $qualityLimit: 0.4
      nativeFieldMatch.occurrenceCountTable.title: &quot;linear(0,1)&quot; #Example of nativeRank tuning, override the occurrence boost shape to be flat
    }

    #our freshness rank feature
    macro freshness() {
      expression: exp(-1 * age(timestamp)/(3600*12))
    }

    #our quality rank feature
    macro quality() {
      expression: attribute(sourcequality)

    #normalization factor for the weighted sum
    macro normalization() {
      expression: $textMatchWeight + $qualityWeight + $deservesFreshness
    }

    macro normalrank() {
      expression: (nativeRank(title,body) + query(qualityWeight) * quality
    }

    #ranking function that runs over all matched documents, determined by the boolean query logic
    first-phase {
      expression: if(quality &lt; query(qualityLimit), normalrank/normalization, (normalrank + query(deservesFreshness) * freshness))/normalization)
    }

    summary-features: nativeRank(title,body) age(date) rankingExpression(freshness@) rankingExpression(quality@)
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Here we use the conditional <em>if</em> operator to implement a tiered
ranking function, where only documents from quality sources are given
freshness boost. The quality limit is passed down with the user query,
so it can be subject to tuning and changes without re-indexing or
re-configuration.
