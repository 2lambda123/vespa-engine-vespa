This document explains the version numbering scheme of Vespa.
</p>

<h1 id="vespa_versions_and_compatibility">Vespa versions and compatibility</h1>

<p>Vespa uses <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>.</p>

<p>Java API's, web service API's and all application package constructs are
supported throughput a major release and only removed on a new release if they
are already marked deprecated.</p>

<p>Use of deprecated Java API's will cause a warning on compilation,
and use of deprecated application package constructs will cause a deprecation
warning on deployment. For web services there is no mechanism for warning
at runtime and we can only mark deprecation in the documentation.</p>

<p>Note that Java API's come in two categories:
<ul>
	<li><i>Public API's</i> carry the compatibility guarantee and are visible from you code
as well as in the <a href="http://vespa.corp.yahoo.com/javadoc/">Vespa javadoc</a>.
	<li><i>Exported API's</i> are also visible from you code, but is not in the public Javadoc
and carry no compatibility guarantee.
</ul>

Check the Javadoc list to verify that you are
using public packages.</p>

<p>In addition, some public Java classes and methods are marked with the
com.google.common.annotations.Beta tag. These are under development and
may still change before they stabilize.</p>


<h1 id="data">Stored Data</h1>

<p>Data written to Vespa is compatible between adjacent releases.
For self-hosted systems it may be necessary to upgrade through each
minor release rather than in larger leaps to ensure Vespa can read existing data.
This is a good practice in any case.
