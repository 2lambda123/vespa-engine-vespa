<p>
Describing the basic flow of incoming requests in the JDisc Container from the
network and into application specific plug-ins requires explaining the
JDisc usage of the general terms <em>binding</em>, <em>server</em> and so on. Let's start
with an informal data flow diagram. Click on a component to jump to an
explanation, or start reading from the top:

<h1 id="server">Server (ServerProvider)</h1>
<p>
A server, or server provider, in JDisc Context is a server protocol
implementation. A server will usually be bound to some network port, and has the
responsibility of creating JDisc requests from the incoming data and also
transmitting the JDisc response back to the client in a pertinent manner. A
server does not fetch content, that is the responsibility of a <a
href="#processor">processor</a> or <a href="#requesthandler">request
handler</a>.
</p>

<h1 id="binding">Binding</h1>

<p>
A binding is a pattern, or rule, matching a URI which is used to route incoming
requests to the correct <a href="#filter">filter chain</a> or <a
href="#requesthandler">request handler</a>, and route outgoing requests to the
correct <a href="#client">client</a>. For instance, the binding <em>http://*/*</em>
would match any HTTP request, while <em>http://*/processing</em> would only match that
specific path. If several bindings match, the most specific one is chosen. </p>

<h2 id="server-binding">server binding</h2>
<p>
A server binding is a rule for matching incoming requests to the correct
request handler, basically the JDisc building block for implementing
RESTful APIs.
</p>

<h2 id="client-binding">client binding</h2>

<p>
A client binding is a pattern which is used to match requests originating inside
the container, e.g. when doing federation, to a client provider. That is, it is
a rule which determines what code should handle a given outgoing request.
</p>

<h1 id="filter">Filter</h1>

<p>
A filter is a lightweight request checker. It may set some specific request
property, or it may do security checking and simply block requests missing some
mandatory property or header.
</p>

<h1 id="request_response">Requests and responses</h1>

<p>Requests are modelled as key-value stores, as in many other systems,
while responses are meta information (like HTTP status) and a binary
stream of content (the <a href="#content-channel">ContentChannel</a> API).
</p>

<p>The response handler is passed along with the request, it is <em>the link
back to the external client</em>, as it contains the infrastructure for passing
binary data back to the network.
</p>

<h2 id="content-channel">content channel</h2>

<p>
A content channel is the basic I/O building block of JDisc. It is conceptually
similar to a stream, but the basic unit is the ByteBuffer instead of the native
byte. A content channel will take ownership of a ByteBuffer written to it.
</p>

<h1 id="requesthandler">Request handlers</h1>

<p>
A request handler accepts a request, and returns a response. All applications
will use a request handler, either by implementing their own, or indirectly by
using the <a href="#processing">processing framework</a>, as the processing
handler is a request handler as well. A client provider is-a request handler.
</p>

<h1 id="processing">Processing</h1>

<p>Processing is a light-weight, low latency request-response framework
built on decomposition by chaining. It is a multi-threaded API, each
processor must be written thread safe.</p>

<h2 id="processor">Processor</h2>

<p>
As a request handler, a processor accepts a response and returns a response.
There are two central differences in the processor API from request handler API,
though. First of all, a processor may invoke other processors directly, as
processors are organized in chains, like filters. Second, processing responses
are structured trees, as opposed to a binary stream. This makes processors
suited to both request and response transformation, as working on both the
request and response is possible.
</p>

<h2 id="renderer">Renderer</h2>

<p>As a processing response is a tree, there must be some way
to transform that to a binary representation. To support multiple output
formats, e.g. JSON and XML, the marshalling work is placed in the plug-in
type Renderer.</p>

<p>A default renderer is always available, this renders a simple JSON
format.</p>

<h1 id="client">Client (ClientProvider)</h1>

<p>
Clients, or client providers, are implementations of clients for different
protocols, or special rules for given protocols. When a JDisc application acts
as a client, e.g. fetches a web page from another host, it is a client provider
that handles the transaction. Bindings are used, as with request handlers and
filters, to choose the correct client, matching protocol, server, etc, and then
hands off the request to the client provider. Obviously, there is no problem in
using arbitrary other types of clients for external services in processors and
request handlers.
