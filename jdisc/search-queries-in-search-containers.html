title: "Invoking search queries from a JDisc component"
---

<p>
It is not necessary as such to dispatch a request through JDisc, with the
overhead associated with that procedure, to perform a search query from e.g. a
request handler running in the JDisc Container if the same container also
functions as a search container. If your application is a search application,
you can simply add the class <em>com.yahoo.search.handler.SearchHandler</em>
to the list of constructor arguments, and invoke its
<em>handle(HttpRequest)</em> method directly. The implementation could look
like the following:
</p>

<p>
Construction:
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
    private final SearchHandler searchHandler;

    public HelloWorld(Executor executor, AccessLog accessLog,
            SearchHandler searchHandler, ResponseConfig config) {
        super(executor, accessLog);
        super(executor, accessLog,null,true);
        this.response = config.response();
        this.searchHandler = searchHandler;
    }
</pre>

<p>
Request handling:
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
    @Override
    public HttpResponse handle(HttpRequest request) {
        HttpRequest searchRequest = new HttpRequest.Builder(request)
                .put(Model.QUERY_STRING, "something to look for")
                .createDirectRequest();
        HttpResponse response = searchHandler.handle(searchRequest);
        return r;
    }
</pre>

<p>
The search will then run directly in the thread owned by
the <em>HelloWorld</em> request handler, and no extra resolving of
URI pattern bindings is necessary.
</p>
