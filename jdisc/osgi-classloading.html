This document describes how to troubleshoot and fix the most common errors we encounter when
working with OSGi bundles, namely:

<ul>
  <li><a href="#class-not-found">Class Not Found</a></li>
  <li><a href="#unresolved-constraint">Unresolved Constraint</a></li>
  <li><a href="#multiple-implementations">Multiple Implementations of the Same Class</a></li>
</ul>

For general information on OSGi bundles for JDisc, please refer to the introduction on how
to <a href="developing-osgi-bundles.html">develop OSGi bundles</a>. We also recommend
Richard S. Hall's presentation on <a
 href="http://felix.apache.org/site/presentations.data/Learning_to_ignore_OSGi.pdf">using
OSGi as a means to achieve modularity</a>, which explains a lot about how OSGi works, and
why.
</p>


<h2 id="class-not-found">Class Not Found</h2>

All classes that are referred to in a user bundle must either be embedded in the bundle,
or imported from another bundle by an <code>Import-Package</code> statement in the bundle
manifest. When this rule has been breached, we get one of the most commonly seen
exceptions when working with OSGi bundles:

<pre class="brush: text">
...
exception=
    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/acme/utils/Helper
    ...
    java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.acme.utils.Helper not found by my_bundle [29]
</pre>
</p>

<p> For the <a href="bundle-plugin.html">bundle-plugin</a> to automatically add an
Import-Package statement to your bundle's manifest, that package must be exported from
another bundle that is declared as a 'provided' scope dependency in <em>pom.xml</em>.
If the
dependency that contains the missing class is under your own control, you should make sure
it's packaged as an OSGi bundle, and <a
 href="bundle-plugin.html#exporting-importing-and-including-packages-from-bundles">export
the package</a> from that bundle.  If not, the simplest way to resolve the issue is to
embed the dependency in your own bundle, by setting its scope to 'compile' instead of
'provided'. </p>

<p> If the strategy above does not resolve the case, it's most likely because the class in
question is loaded by reflection,
e.g. <code>Class.forName("com.acme.utils.Helper")</code>. This is quite common when working
with libraries for pluggable frameworks, for which we have a separate <a
 href="pluggable-frameworks.html"> troubleshooting doc</a>.  </p>


<h2 id="unresolved-constraint">Unresolved Constraint</h2>

<p> If your bundle has an Import-Package for a package that is not available at runtime,
the OSGi framework will report an unresolved constraint error. The symptom as seen in the
log is (line breaks have been added for readability):

<pre class="brush: text">
org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Unresolved constraint in bundle my_bundle [29]:
Unable to resolve 29.0:
missing requirement [29.0] osgi.wiring.package; (osgi.wiring.package=<span style="background: yellow">com.acme.utils</span>)
     at org.apache.felix.framework.Felix.resolveBundleRevision(Felix.java:3974)
</pre>
</p>

<p> This means that the missing class resides in a 'provided' dependency referred to from
your bundle's <em>pom.xml</em>, either directly or transitively. In order to make the dependency
available at runtime, just put the missing jar file in the <code>components/</code> folder
of your application package, along with your own bundles. If the missing jar is a
transitive dependency, maven can help visualize the dependency graph of your project:
<pre class="brush: cli">
$ mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.8:tree
</pre>
</p>


<h2 id="multiple-implementations">Multiple Implementations of the Same Class</h2>
<p>

When two bundles interact via their public APIs, it is crucial that both bundles resolve
each and every participating class to the same <code>Class</code> object. If not, we will
get error messages like:

<pre class="brush: text">
    java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving field
"DATETIME" the class loader (instance of
org/apache/felix/framework/BundleWiringImpl$BundleClassLoaderJava5) of the referring
class, javax/xml/datatype/DatatypeConstants, and the class loader (instance of
&lt;bootloader&gt;) for the field's resolved type, pe/DatatypeConstants, have different Class
objects for that type
</pre>
or:
<pre class="brush: text">
    java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: loader (instance of &lt;bootloader&gt;)
previously initiated loading for a different type with name "<span style="background: yellow">javax/xml/namespace/QName</span>"
</pre>
or (less frequently):
<pre class="brush: text">
    java.lang.ClassCastException: com.acme.utils.Helper cannot be cast to  com.acme.utils.Helper
</pre>
</p>

<p>
All these error messages indicate that multiple implementations of one or more classes are
used at runtime. This could mean that either

<ul>
  <li>Two interacting user bundles embed the same Java package.</li>
  <li>A user bundle embeds a Java package that is exported from one of the JDisc bundles.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Usually, the "duplicate" package is pulled in by the user bundle transitively from a
library dependency.

<h3 id="multiple-implementations-example">Troubleshooting Example</h3>
<p>
Let's take a look at an example resolving the duplicate <span style="background:
yellow">javax.xml.namespace.QName</span> class from the error message above.
</p>

<p> All 'javax.xml' packages in the JDK are exported by the JDisc core bundle. This means
that they should be imported by user bundles, instead of embedded inside them.  Hence, we
should ensure that there are no classes from packages prefixed by 'javax.xml' in our
bundle. To find out which library that pulls in the package, we can use the following
procedure:

<ol>
  <li>Extract the full component jar, including any embedded jars. One
  tool that does the job is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rjar/">rjar</a>.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>Search the folder where the jar was extracted for 'javax.xml' classes. For example:
<pre class="brush: cli">
$ find . | grep "javax/xml/.*\.class"
</pre>
  This will yield output like:
<pre class="brush: cli">
...
./my_bundle-deploy.jar/dependencies/<span style="background: yellow">stax-api-1.0.1.jar</span>/javax/xml/namespace/QName.class
...
  </pre>
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>Now we need to find out which libraries that pulled in the offending classes. From this
  example, it was <code>stax-api-1.0.1</code>. Usually, these libraries are not
  pulled in by our pom as direct dependencies, but rather transitively via another library that we
  are using. In order to find the direct dependency, use maven's dependency plugin from your application
  directory:
 <pre class="brush: cli">
$ mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.8:tree -Dverbose
</pre>
  This will yield output like:
<pre class="brush: cli">
[INFO] +- com.acme.utils:jersey-utils:1.0.0:compile
[INFO] |  +- com.sun.jersey:jersey-json:jar:1.13:compile
[INFO] |  |  +- org.codehaus.jettison:jettison:jar:1.1:compile
[INFO] |  |    \- <span style="background: yellow">stax:stax-api:jar:1.0.1:compile</span>
</pre>
  We can now see that <code>stax:stax-api:1.0.1</code> is pulled in transitively from our direct
  dependency <code>com.acme.utils:jersey-utils</code>.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    Finally, to exclude <code>stax:stax-api</code> we must add the appropriate
  <code>exclusion</code> from our direct dependency <code>com.acme.utils:jersey-utils</code>, in
  <em>pom.xml</em>:
 <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;dependency&gt;
          &lt;groupId&gt;com.acme.utils&lt;/groupId&gt;
          &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-utils&lt;/artifactId&gt;
          &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
          <span style="background: yellow">&lt;exclusions&gt;</span>
            <span style="background: yellow">&lt;exclusion&gt;</span>
              <span style="background: yellow">&lt;groupId&gt;stax&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
             <span style="background: yellow"> &lt;artifactId&gt;stax-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
           <span style="background: yellow"> &lt;/exclusion&gt;</span>
          <span style="background: yellow">&lt;/exclusions&gt;</span>
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="multiple-implementations-example-slf4j">Troubleshooting Example slf4j-api</h3>
<p>
This is similar to the previous example, but logging libraries are maybe the most common
problem teams encounter. Here we will see the symptom, use dependency:tree and add an exclusion.
The symptom:
</p>

<pre>
  java.lang.RuntimeException: An exception occurred while
  constructing 'com.acme.utils.Helper in acme-utils'
  Caused by: java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving method
  "<span style="background: yellow">org.slf4j</span>.impl.StaticLoggerBinder.getLoggerFactory()Lorg/slf4j/ILoggerFactory;"
  the class loader (instance of org/apache/felix/framework/BundleWiringImpl$BundleClassLoaderJava5) of the
  current class, org/slf4j/LoggerFactory, and the class loader (instance of
  sun/misc/Launcher$AppClassLoader) for the method's defining class,
  org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder, have different Class objects for the type
  org/slf4j/ILoggerFactory used in the signature
  at
  org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getILoggerFactory(LoggerFactory.java:299)
  at
  org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggerFactory.java:269)
</pre>
<p>
Running the mvn dependency:tree command in the previous example gives:
</p>
<pre>
[INFO] +- com.yahoo.vespa:container-dev:jar:5.28.29:provided
[INFO] |  +- com.yahoo.vespa:jdisc_core:jar:5.28.29:provided
[INFO] |  |  +- (org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.7.5:compile - scope updated from provided; omitted for duplicate)
...
[INFO] +- com.acme.utils:smartlib:jar:1.0.0:compile
[INFO] |  +- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.6.6:compile
</pre>
<p>
We see that slf4j-api is no longer provided from container-dev, which it should. To fix this, we add an exclusion
on the offender:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.acme.utils&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;smartlib&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
      &lt;exclusion&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;/exclusion&gt;
</pre>
<p>
But it still does not work! And we can see why:
</p>
<pre>
$ jar -tf mailsearch-docprocs-deploy.jar  | grep slf
dependencies/slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar
</pre>
<p>
Something still pulls in slf4j... Other candidates:
</p>
<pre>
[INFO] \- com.yahoo.vespa:application:jar:5.28.29:test
...
[INFO]    +- com.yahoo.vespa:zkfacade:jar:5.28.29:test
[INFO]    |  +- org.apache.curator:curator-recipes:jar:2.4.1:test
[INFO]    |  |  +- org.apache.curator:curator-framework:jar:2.4.1:test
[INFO]    |  |  |  +- org.apache.curator:curator-client:jar:2.4.1:test
[INFO]    |  |  |  |  +- (org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.6.4:test - omitted for conflict with 1.7.5)
...
[INFO]    |  +- (org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14:jar:1.7.5:test - omitted for duplicate)
</pre>
<p>
Added the right excludes for application and used mvn dependency:tree and verified that all references were
gone, except the ones for container-dev. Still found:
</p>
<pre>
  $ jar -tf mailsearch-docprocs-deploy.jar  | grep slf
  dependencies/slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar
</pre>
<p>
One can make it work by managing this dependency explicitly - add this at POM top-level:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
    &lt;dependencies&gt;
      &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.7.5&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
      &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;
  &lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;
</pre>
