    <p>
      The <code>com.yahoo.jdisc.service.RequestHandler</code>
      (<a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/RequestHandler.html">javadoc</a>)
      interface defines a component that is capable of acting as a handler for a
      Request. This document explains how to implement and deploy a custom request
      handler.
    </p>
    <p>
      All request processing in a JDisc application is done by request
      handlers. Implementations of the <code>RequestHandler</code> interface are bound to
      one or more URI patterns, and invoked
      by <a href="developing-server-providers.html">server providers</a> or other request
      handlers. Upon receiving a request, the request handler must consume its content,
      process it, and then return a response back to the
      provided <code>ResponseHandler</code>.

      To implement a request handler, either implement the
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/RequestHandler.html"><code>RequestHandler</code></a>
      interface directly, or subclass the more convenient
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/AbstractRequestHandler.html"><code>AbstractRequestHandler</code></a>,
      the JDisc container also has several <a href="choosing-handler-base-class.html">utility base classes</a> available.

      Please note the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All request handlers need to implement some <a href="#handle-request">request
        handling logic</a>, as well as some <a href="#dispatch-response">response dispatch
        logic</a>.</li>
      <li>In case a request handler needs to <a href="#dispatch-request">dispatch client
        requests</a>, it must also implement <a href="#handle-response">response handling
        logic</a>.</li>
      <li>A <a href="#request-timeout">request's timeout</a> is the maximum allowed time
        from when <code>handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> is invoked until
        <code>handleResponse(Response)</code> must have been called.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To install a request handler in a JDisc Container, use
      the <a href="../reference/services-jdisc.html#handler">handler</a>
      element in <em>services.xml</em>, e.g.:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;jdisc id="default" version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;handler id="my.package.MyRequestHandler" bundle="MyBundleSymbolicName"&gt;
        &lt;binding&gt;http://*/*&lt;/binding&gt;
    &lt;/handler&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;
        &lt;node hostalias="node1" /&gt;
    &lt;/nodes&gt;
&lt;/jdisc&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
      Notice that the <code>binding</code> element declared within a <code>handler</code>
      element implies a server-binding. To configure a client-binding for a request
      handler, use the <code>clientBinding</code> element instead.
    </p>

    <h2 id="handle-request">Handling a request</h2>
    <p>
      A request handler is invoked by a call to its <code>handleRequest(Request,
      ResponseHandler)</code> method. Because JDisc enforces no specific threading model,
      this call may be performed by any thread -- even some critical IO thread that
      belongs to one of the configured server providers. Because of this you
      should <u>never</u> perform much work in the body of the
      <code>handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> method. Instead, you should
      pass the necessary context to some known thread pool.

      The <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ThreadedRequestHandler.html"><code>ThreadedRequestHandler</code></a>
      provides an efficient implementation of such handover.

      Once invoked, a request handler must create and return a <code>ContentChannel</code>
      into which the caller can write the request's payload.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no specific order, the request handler must now
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#read-content">read the content</a> of the request, and</li>
      <li><a href="#dispatch-response">dispatch a response</a> to the given response
        handler.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="read-content">Reading from a ContentChannel</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentChannel.html"><code>ContentChannel</code></a>
      provides an asynchronous interface for <code>ByteBuffer</code> handover --
      where <em>handover</em> implies that the caller will never reuse the buffer. The
      buffer may safely be stored and processed at some point in the future.

      A content channel is required to be thread-safe, but it is the caller that is
      expected to perform the necessary external synchronization to avoid out-of-order
      calls; a second call to <code>write(ByteBuffer, CompletionHandler)</code> will
      never be initiated before the first call has returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The optional (in the sense that it might be <code>null</code>)
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/CompletionHandler.html"><code>CompletionHandler</code></a>
      provides support for asynchronous notification of the completion or failure of a
      call to a content channel. Notice that unless your implementation of the content
      channel throws an exception during a <code>write(ByteBuffer,
      CompletionHandler)</code> or <code>close(CompletionHandler)</code>, it
      is <u>required</u> that you explicitly call the corresponding completion handler at
      some point in the future.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Instead of developing your own <code>ContentChannel</code>, please consider using
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/BufferedContentChannel.html"><code>BufferedContentChannel</code></a>
      if you intend to forward the content without blocking or copying, or
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ReadableContentChannel.html"><code>ReadableContentChannel</code></a>
      if you intend to access the content yourself. Both provide convenient access to
      the <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentInputStream.html"><code>ContentInputStream</code></a>
      and <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentReader.html"><code>ContentReader</code></a>
      interfaces to safely read their content.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dispatch-response">Dispatching a response</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ResponseHandler.html"><code>ResponseHandler</code></a>
      is the callback to be invoked once a request has been sufficiently processed. The
      response may be dispatched by any thread, and at any time -- even before the
      call to the request handler returns.

      The response handler is the second argument of the request
      handler's <code>handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> method, and it is
      commonly a one-off object.

      Notice that unless the call to the request handler throws an exception, it
      is <u>required</u> that you call the response handler <u>exactly once</u> at some
      point in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a response has been constructed, it is dispatched by calling
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ResponseHandler.html#handleResponse(com.yahoo.jdisc.Response)"><code>responseHandler.handleResponse(Response)</code></a>.
      The returned <code>ContentChannel</code> must then be used to asynchronously
      <a href="#write-content">write the content</a> of the response into it. Notice
      that unless the call to the response handler threw an exception, it is
      <u>required</u> that you explicitly close the returned content channel at some point
      in the future.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Instead of explicitly managing the dispatch of a response yourself, please consider
      using the
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ResponseDispatch.html"><code>ResponseDispatch</code></a>
      utility class to safely dispatch your response.
    </p>

    <h2 id="write-content">Writing to a ContentChannel</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentChannel.html"><code>ContentChannel</code></a>
      provides an asynchronous interface for <code>ByteBuffer</code> handover --
      where <em>handover</em> implies that you may never reuse a buffer that you
      have written to it.

      All content channels are thread-safe, but it is your responsibility to perform the
      necessary synchronization to avoid out-of-order calls to it; a second call
      to <code>write(ByteBuffer, CompletionHandler)</code> should never be initiated
      before the first call has returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The optional (in the sense you are allowed to pass <code>null</code> for it)
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/CompletionHandler.html"><code>CompletionHandler</code></a>
      provides support for asynchronous notification of the completion or failure of a
      call to a content channel. Unless an exception is thrown in a call
      to <code>write(ByteBuffer, CompletionHandler)</code>
      or <code>close(CompletionHandler)</code>, you are guaranteed to have your
      completion handler called at some point in the future.

      Notice that it is <u>required</u> that you explicitly close all content channels --
      regardless of whether some call to it threw an exception
      or <code>failed(Throwable)</code> was invoked on some completion handler.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Please consider using
      the <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentOutputStream.html"><code>ContentOutputStream</code></a>
      or <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentWriter.html"><code>ContentWriter</code></a>
      to safely write to a content channel.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dispatch-request">Dispatching a client request</h2>
    <p>
      If a request handler decides to create and dispatch a
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/Request.html#Request(com.yahoo.jdisc.Request,%20java.net.URI)">child-request</a>,
      it is done through the same binding set mechanics that was used to resolve the
      current request handler. However, where server providers resolve their dispatch
      against server-bindings, request handlers will resolve their dispatch against
      client-bindings. This behavior can be overriden through the use of the
      <code><a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/Request.html#setServerRequest(boolean)">setServerRequest(boolean)</a></code>
      method.

      Notice that the request maintains a reference to the
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/service/CurrentContainer.html"><code>CurrentContainer</code></a>,
      and that you are <u>required</u> to release the local reference once the request has
      been dispatched, to allow the JDisc Container to cleanly shut down at some point in
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the child-request and a response handler has been constructed, it is dispatched
      by calling
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/Request.html#connect(com.yahoo.jdisc.handler.ResponseHandler)"><code>request.connect(ResponseHandler)</code></a>.
      The returned <code>ContentChannel</code> must then be used to asynchronously
      <a href="#write-content">write the content</a> of the request into it. Notice that
      unless the call to connect threw an exception, it is <u>required</u> that you
      explicitly close the returned content channel at some point in the future.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Instead of explicitly managing the dispatch of a request yourself, please consider
      using the
      <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/RequestDispatch.html"><code>RequestDispatch</code></a>
      utility class to safely dispatch requests.
    </p>

    <h2 id="handle-response">Handling a client response</h2>
    <p>
      As a client provider responds to a request, the response handler that was part of
      the request dispatch is invoked.

      Because JDisc enforces no specific threading model, this call may be performed by
      any thread -- even some critical IO thread that belongs to one of the configured
      client providers. Because of this you should <u>never</u> perform much work in the
      body of the <code>handleResponse(Response)</code> method.

      Also, because the response may be dispatched at any time, the response handler may
      be invoked even before the call to dispatch the request returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once invoked, a response handler must create and return a <code>ContentChannel</code>
      into which the caller can write the response's payload. At some point in the future,
      this payload then needs be <a href="#read-content">consumed</a> and acted upon.
    </p>

    <h2 id="request-timeout">Request timeout</h2>
    <p>
      A request may or may not have an assigned timeout. Such a timeout is the total amount
      of time that a request handler may spend processing a request before the
      corresponding call to <code>handleResponse(Response)</code> is made. If no timeout
      is assigned to a request, there will be no timeout.

      Once the allocated time has expired, unless the response handler has already been
      called, the request handler's <code>handleTimeout(Request, ResponseHandler)</code>
      method is invoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>ResponseHandler</code> passed to the timeout method is the
      same <code>ResponseHandler</code> that was initially passed to the
      <code>handleRequest()</code> method.

      There is a built-in guard against calling the <code>ResponseHandler</code> more than once,
      so you do not need additional synchronization to prevent a late response from calling the
      handler of a request that has already timed out.

      The <code>handleTimeout()</code> method is called by the timeout manager's own
      thread.

      Any exception thrown in <code>handleTimeout()</code> is ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that you are <u>required</u> to call the given response handler from within
      <code>handleTimeout(Request, ResponseHandler)</code>. Failure to do so will prevent
      the JDisc Container from cleanly shutting down.
    </p>
