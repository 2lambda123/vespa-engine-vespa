  This document lists the terms which have a well defined meaning in Vespa.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt id="administration-server">Administration server</dt><dd>

    href="#search-definition" class="glossary">search definitions</a>. Search result templates,
    configuration files. Components, such as <a href="#searcher" class="glossary">searchers</a>
    can also be part of the application package.
  </dd>
  <dt id="attribute">Attribute</dt><dd>
    A document <a href="#field" class="glossary">field</a> which is stored in memory in an <a
    href="#index-structure" class="glossary">index structure</a> to provide efficient <a
    href="#grouping" class="glossary">grouping</a> and <a href="#sorting" class="glossary">sorting</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt id="back-end">Backend</dt><dd>
    The part of a content cluster keeping persistent data, on top of which
    the <a href="#content-layer" class="glossary">content layer</a> creates a multi-node cluster.
    The backend must implement the persistence provider interface in order to
    interface with the content layer. In search context, the backend refers
    to a <a href="#search-node" class="glossary">search node</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt id="bcp">BCP - Business Continuity Planning</dt><dd>
    BCP is a generic term for planning for incidents ahead of time, to limit
    the effects of an incident. In the context of Vespa, BCP is considered to be
    the ability to run clusters with similar functionality at different
    geographic locations, such that in the event of a colo outage can be handled
    without loss of services.
    BCP solutions can be split into two types. Master-master and master-slave.
    In the former, write requests for any part of the data may be sent to any
    cluster, while in the latter all write traffic must go through the master
    cluster for that piece of data. Master-master have the advantage of allowing
    geographically local writes, possibly reducing write latencies, but adds
    complexity in ensuring that the data kept is consistent.
  </dd>
  <dt id="blending">Blending</dt><dd>
    To combine <a href="#result" class="glossary">results</a> from multiple <a
    href="#search-cluster" class="glossary">search clusters</a> into one result. Done by the <a
    href="#qrs" class="glossary">QRS</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt id="bucket">Bucket</dt><dd>
    The content layer splits all the <a href="#document" class="glossary">documents</a> in the
    cluster into buckets, like buckets in a hash map.  Routing, distribution,
    consistency, redundancy and maintenance operations are done at a bucket
    level. Refer to the <a
    href="../content/design-overview.html#buckets">content layer design
    overview</a> for more information about buckets.
  </dd>
  <dt id="capacity">Capacity</dt><dd>
    Capacities are relative values that affects content cluster distribution,
    allowing heterogenous hardware to be used while utilizing allowing all
    nodes to fully utilize the bottleneck resource at about the same time.
  </dd>
  <dt id="cjk-languages">CJK languages</dt><dd>
    Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Languages with no punctuation, for which <a
    href="#tokenization" class="glossary">tokenization</a> is particularly difficult.
  </dd>
  <dt id="client">Client</dt><dd>
    A client is some entity using the component the given context is talking
    about, which are not part of the component itself. For instance, in the
    context of the storage backend, the client may be the content layer, the
    HTTP gateway, an application using the HTTP gateway, a property using Vespa
    for data storage, or a user on the internet using the property.
  </dd>
  <dt id="cluster">Cluster</dt><dd>
    A cluster is a group of nodes performing similar functions, where clients
    typically divide load among the nodes. Clusters are created to allow
    services to scale by altering node count and to cope with node failures.
    The clusters in an application share configuration, log and other
    administrative services, but individual clusters operate independent of
    each other.
  </dd>
  <dt id="cluster-controller">Cluster controller</dt><dd>
    A process in the content layer that tracks health of all content cluster
    nodes, generating cluster states, used for routing, distribution and node
    fault tolerance.
  </dd>
  <dt id="cluster-state">Cluster State</dt><dd>
    The combined <a href="#node-state" class="glossary">node states</a> from all nodes in a
    content <a href="#cluster" class="glossary">cluster</a>. Used by content layer for routing

    The server which configures an entire <a href="#vespa-system" class="glossary">Vespa
    system</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt id="consistent">Consistent</dt><dd>
    In the context of the content layer, a consistent bucket is a bucket that
    does not overlap with any other buckets, and where all the copies of the
    bucket contains the same data. If the bucket overlaps with another bucket
    those buckets are said to be inconsistently split. If the bucket copies are
    inconsistent they need to be synchronized through a maintenance operation
    called a merge. Note that a bucket need not be stored on the correct
    nodes to be consistent.
  </dd>
  <dt id="content-layer">Content layer</dt><dd>
    Short for the content distribution layer. This is a layer enabling a single
    node stateful service to become a multi-node elastic service. Search and
    storage use the content layer to implement elasticity and multi-node
    aspects of the service, such as routing, distribution, scaling, consistency
    availability and redundancy.
  </dd>
  <dt id="content-node">Content node</dt><dd>
    A content layer process linking the service layer component of the content
    layer with the backend implementing the persistence provider.
  </dd>
  <dt id="crud">CRUD operations</dt><dd>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">
      Creeate, read, update and delete</a> are the four basic functions of
      persistent storage. In Vespa context these are called put, get, update
      and remove.

  <dt id="dispatch-node">Dispatch node</dt><dd>
    The service which is responsible for dispatching queries to the nodes of a

    to detect inconsistencies. Forwards and fans out requests, in addition to
    initiating maintenance operations when needed.
  </dd>
  <dt id="distribution-algorithm">Distribution algorithm</dt><dd>
    The algorithm used to decide what nodes are responsible for a given bucket.
    The nodes calculated to be responsible for buckets are called the ideal
    nodes or ideal location for that bucket. The distribution algorithm is thus
    also referred to as the ideal state algorithm.

  <dt id="hit">Hit</dt><dd>
    A piece of information belonging to the <a href="#result" class="glossary">result</a> of a
    <a href="#query" class="glossary">query</a>. Usually a hit represents a <a

  <dt id="ideal-state">Ideal state</dt><dd>
    A content cluster where all buckets are consistent, and they are all stored
    in correct number of copies on the nodes where the distribution algorithm
    wants them to be stored, is said to be in the ideal state. If the cluster
    is not in ideal state, maintenace operations will be scheduled to get to the
    ideal state. They may take some time to perform, and are typically lower
    priority than external load. Thus the clusters current state may often
    differ a bit from the ideal state. Especially if the cluster is close to
    being overloaded or have unstable nodes.

  <dt id="reprocessing">Reprocessing</dt><dd>
    A content layer feature implemented on top of <a href="#visit" class="glossary">visiting</a>.
    Fetch all or a subset of the stored documents, send them somewhere to be
    processed which sends the processed documents back to the content layer.
    Typically implemented by using a messagebus route to send the data to
    document processing and back. Can for instance be used to alter the
    document type in non compatible ways, or to reindex documents after the
    application have changed.
  </dd>
  <dt id="request">Request</dt><dd>
    Requests are function calls in a programmatic API, or messages in a network
    API, sent to a target in order to process it and send a response, possibly
    mutating internal data kept. In most context, requests are document inserts,
    removals, updates and similar. There are also internal requests though,
    such as parts of a maintenance operation, and both types may be broken into
    more primitive requests.

  <dt id="service-layer">Service Layer</dt><dd>
    For the content layer to be able to talk to the backend instances,
    efficiently move data between backend nodes, hide the network protocols,
    and divide complex operations into simpler functions, the backend instances
    need to link with the service layer, which is part of the content layer
    solving those issues.
