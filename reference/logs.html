<h1>Vespa log files</h1>

<p>
This reference contains an overview of how to handle Vespa logs.  All
Vespa components use a common log module for logging. These log
messages are added to a local logfile in <em>$VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa/</em> on each
node and sent to the log server on the administration node. The log archive and
rotation is explained in <a href="#log_rotation">log
rotation</a>.
</p>


    <h1 id="contents">Logfile content</h1>

    <p>Logfiles are in a machine-readable log format, which can be made
    more human-readable by the <a href="logfmt.html">logfmt</a> program. Each line that is logged
    consists of the following fields, in order, separated by a TAB (ASCII
    9) character:</p>

    <pre class="code">time host pid service component level message</pre>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Log field</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>time</tt></em></td><td>Time in seconds since 1970-01-01 UTC,
      with optional fractional seconds after. E.g. 1102675319.726342</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>host</tt></em></td><td>The hostname of the machine that
      produced this log entry</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>pid</tt></em></td><td>The process id, and an optional
      thread-id of the process/thread that logged the message</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>service</tt></em></td><td>The Vespa service name of the
      logger</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>component</tt></em></td><td>The component name that
      logged. An application may have many different sub-components with their own
      component names, usually starts with the name of the binary.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>level</tt></em></td><td>One of fatal, error, warning, info,
      config, event, debug, or spam</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>message</tt></em></td><td>The log message itself. All
      dangerous characters are escaped (CR, NL, TAB, \, ASCII &lt; 32 and ASCII
      128..159)</td></tr>
    </table>


    <p>The log levels are:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Log level</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>fatal</tt></em></td><td>Fatal error messages. The
      application must exit immediately, and restarting it will not
      help.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>error</tt></em></td><td>Error messages. These are serious,
      the application cannot function correctly.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>warning</tt></em></td><td>Warnings - the application may be
      able to continue, but the situation should be looked into</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>info</tt></em></td><td>Informational messages that are not
      reporting error conditions, but should still be useful to the
      operator.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>config</tt></em></td><td>Configuration settings</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>event</tt></em></td><td>Machine-readable events. May contain
      information about processes starting and stopping, and various
      metrics.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>debug</tt></em></td><td>Debug messages. These are normally
      suppressed and will not show up.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>spam</tt></em></td><td>Very low-level debug messages. These
      are normally suppressed, and will generate massive amounts of logs quickly
      if enabled</td></tr>
    </table>



    <h1 id="reading_logs">Reading logs</h1>

    <p>Logs can be read directly, but they are usually easier to read when
    using the <em>logfmt</em> program. This program can filter out log messages
    from specific programs, only show certain log levels, print the time
    in a more directly understandable format and so on.</p>

    <p>The manual page <em>logfmt</em>(1) has full documentation for the
    <em>logfmt</em> program.</p>



    <h1 id="controlling_log_level">Controlling log levels</h1>

    <p>Vespa programs running as services can have their active log levels modified at
    run-time by the logctl program. Standalone programs (such as vespafeeder) will
    instead read the environment variable <em>VESPA_LOG_LEVEL</em> on startup to
    determine which log levels should be active.</p>

    <p>The default setting for <em>VESPA_LOG_LEVEL</em> is <em>"all -debug -spam"</em>,
    which enables all log levels except debug and spam.

    <p><em>logctl</em> can alter the active log levels for a program, or for
    parts of a program, while it is running. This is especially useful for
    enabling debug output in parts of a live system for diagnosing problems. It
    can also be used to silence programs that are too verbose in their
    logging.</p>

    <p><em>logctl -h</em> shows how to use the program. Programs that can be
    controlled by logctl put log control files in
    <em>$VESPA_HOME/var/db/vespa/logcontrol/service.logcontrol</em>.
    If this file exists on program startup, it will be used to set the logging
    levels. This means that log level modifications done with <em>logctl</em>
    are sticky, and can also be performed even if the program isn't running.</p>



    <h1 id="real_time">Real-time monitoring of logs</h1>

    <p>
        One of the standard plugins in the log server is the
        <em>Replicator</em> plugin. This plugin is able to replicate log
        messages to other interested services or parties. To use this
        plugin, telnet to port 19083 on the log server.
        You may use the <a href="">Vespa model inspector</a>
        to verify that the logserver has a port tagged with
        'telnet logtp' at 19083.
    </p>

<pre class="code">
telnet host 19083
</pre>

    <p>
        After telneting, you can apply a message filter. To list the
        message filters available, simply write <code>list</code>. To
        apply a message filter, use <code>use &lt;filter&gt;</code>, like
        this:
    </p>

<pre class="code">
Connected to host.
Escape character is '^]'.
list
# 203 filter list
# 204 system.all - Match all log messages
# 204 system.metricsevents - Match all Count and Value messages
# 204 system.allevents - Match specific log levels
# 204 system.nometricsevents - Matches all log messages except Count and Value events
# 204 system.mute - Matches no messages.  Mute.
# 205 end filter list
use system.all
# 200 using 'com.yahoo.logserver.filter.NullFilter@62974e'
</pre>


    <h1 id="log_rotation">Log rotation</h1>

    <p>
        On the log server on the administration node, the <em>Archiver</em>
        plugin will write the log messages from each
        node to a log archive. These messages are written to the correct
        log file based on the message timestamp. The log files are located
        in the <code>$VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa/logarchive</code> directory.
        The catalog structure is like this:
    </p>

<pre class="code">
logarchive/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt;/&lt;hour&gt;-&lt;serial&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
    For instance will a message logged at 2016-07-22 08:05:00 be found
    in:
    </p>

<pre class="code">
logarchive/2016/07/20/08-0
</pre>

    <p>
        All dates and times are in UTC. If the log file exceeds 20 Mb,
        the file will be rotated and the serial number will increase. These
        files are the same that are available through the web interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        The log archive might grow large - to disable storing of metrics in log
        archive, set the <code>vespa_log_server.archive_metric</code> environment setting to off.
        If you later need to debug using metric data, aggregate these by hand
        from the individual nodes in the system.
    </p>


    <h1 id="queryaccesslog">QRS log file content</h1>

    <p>QRS logs each query it executes in its access log.
    The log files are named QueryAccessLog.&lt;timestamp&gt; and can be found in $VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa/qrs/ on QRS nodes.
    Each line that is logged consists of the following fields, in order, separated by a space character:</p>

    <pre class="code">SourceIP - - [Date] "HTTPRequest" HTTPReturnCode ByteCount "Referrer" "UserAgent" ProcessingTime TotalHitCount 0 HitCount</pre>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Log field</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>SourceIP </tt></em></td><td>IP address of client </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>- </tt></em></td><td>Nothing </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>- </tt></em></td><td>Nothing </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>Date </tt></em></td><td>Timestamp (localtime) when query was executed with offset from GMT </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>HTTPRequest </tt></em></td><td>HTTP request string </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>HTTPReturnCode </tt></em></td><td>HTTP return
      code for the query
      <ul>
          <li>200 for ok</li>
      </ul>
          </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>ByteCount </tt></em></td><td>Number of bytes sent to the client </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>Referrer </tt></em></td><td>HTTP referrer string </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>UserAgent </tt></em></td><td>Client user agent </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>ProcessingTime </tt></em></td><td>Time used to process the query in seconds. Including query parsing, back end execution. Does by design not include query reception from client and result set transfer time to client.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>TotalHitCount </tt></em></td><td>The total number of hits for the result set. </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>0 </tt></em></td><td>Reserved for later expansion - always 0 </td></tr>
      <tr><td><em><tt>HitCount </tt></em></td><td>Number of hits in the query result page. Note that the number of grouping results (if there are any) is included in this number </td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="events-and-access-log">Time values in the access log compared to
            metrics and log events</h2>

      <p>The timing in the access log will in general be slightly off compared
      to the timing values in the vespa.log.
      The reason is the “probes” into the system are placed at slightly
      different levels of abstraction. The explanations here are directed at
      experienced users and troubleshooting.</p>

      <h3>Definition of processing time in the access log</h3>

      <p>Processing time in the access log starts when the execution is first
      invoked from the search handler. The end is dependent on whether
      the response is aynschronous or not. For a synchronous response, the
      end is after the renderer has been invoked, but before the rendering
      buffer is flushed. For an asynchronous response, e.g. a normal
      search response, the end is defined as when the completion handler
      is created. That means after control flow has returned from the
      search chains, but before any network traffic or rendering has been
      done.</p>

      <h3>Definition of processing time in the vespa.log</h3>

      <p>StatisticsSearcher defines the metric <em>query_latency</em> and the log event
      <em>mean_query_latency</em>. The data fed into these is identical. The start of
      the interval is defined as when the control flow enters
      StatisticsSearcher, the end as when the next searcher after
      StatisticsSearcher returns from search(). This has the unfortunate side
      effect of <i>not</i> including fill time of the result was not already
      filled when passed on from StatisticsSearcher. This may happen if the
      SearchHandler has to invoke fill() itself, e.g. if no searchers need to
      access hit fields.</p>

      <h3>Timing summary</h3>

      <p>The access log includes everything happening before rendering, but
      will exclude expensive rendering logic and slow networks. The query
      latency event and metrics only covers what happens inside the search
      chain where StatisticsSearcher is placed, and may exclude summary
      fetching.</p>

    <h2 id="zookeeper">ZooKeeper Log</h2>
    <p>
    The ZooKeeper log file is normally not necessary to monitor on a regular basis,
    but is mentioned here as a possible source of information in case you
    should ever need to debug the Vespa configuration system. Is is located at
    <code>$VESPA_HOME/logs/vespa/zookeeper.&lt;servicename&gt;.log</code>.
