title: "List of Ports Used by Vespa"
---

<p class="ingress">
The following is an overview of which ports and port ranges are used
by the different services in a Vespa system. Please note that for
services capable of running multiple instances on the same node, all
instances will run within the listed port range.
</p>

<p>
Many services are allocated ports dynamically. So even though the
allocation is deterministic, i.e. the same system will get the same
ports on subsequent startups, a particular service instance may get
different ports when the overall system setup is changed through
the <code>services.xml</code> configuration file.  Use
the <a href="vespa-model-inspect.html">Vespa
Model Inspector</a> to see the actual port allocations in your
currently deployed system.

<ul>
  <li>The number of ports used in a range depends on number of
      instances that are running.</li>
  <li>Not all ports within a range are used, but they are assigned
      each service to support future extensions.</li>
  <li>The range from 19100 is used for internal communication ports,
      i.e. ports that are not necessary to use from an external
      API.</li>
  <li>See <a href="../jdisc/http-server-and-filters.html">
Configuring Http Servers and Filters</a> for how to configure JDisc
  ports and <a href="services.html#attr-baseport">the services.xml
