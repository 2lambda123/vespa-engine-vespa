<p class="ingress">
This document will show you how to determine the state of each running
Java Vespa service using a tool called JConsole.
</p>



<h1 id="starting-jconsole">Starting JConsole</h1>
<p>
The JConsole tool is distributed along with the Java developer kit. It
can be started as follows:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ jconsole &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
</pre>

<p>
where the host and port determine which service to attach
to. Unfortunately, for security purposes the JConsole tool can not
directly attach to Vespa services from external machines.
</p>



<h1 id="connecting">Connecting to a Vespa Service</h1>

<p>
To attach a JConsole to a Vespa service running on another host, you
must first create a tunnel from the JConsole host to the Vespa service
host. This can for example be done by setting up two SSH tunnels as
follows:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ ssh -N -L&lt;port1&gt;:localhost:&lt;port1&gt; &lt;service-host&gt; &amp;
$ ssh -N -L&lt;port2&gt;:localhost:&lt;port2&gt; &lt;service-host&gt; &amp;
</pre>

<p>
where port1 and port2 are determined by the type of service (see
below). A JConsole can then be attached to the service as follows:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ jconsole localhost:&lt;port1&gt;
</pre>



<h1 id="port-numbers">Port Numbers for Each Service</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Service</th>
      <th>Port 1</th>
      <th>Port 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>QRS</td>
      <td>19015</td>
      <td>19016</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Docproc</td>
      <td>19123</td>
      <td>19124</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Updated port information can be found by running:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ vespa-model-inspect service &lt;servicename&gt;
</pre>

<p>
where the resulting RMIREGISTRY and JMX lines determine port1 and
port2 respectively.
</p>


<h1 id="examining-states">Examining QRS thread states</h1>

<p>
The state of each QRS is available in JConsole by pressing the Threads
tab and selecting the thread of interest in the threads list.
</p>

<p>
Threads of interest includes search, connector, closer, transport and
acceptor (the latter four are used for backend communications).
