<p>
This document describes how to live-upgrade a Vespa cluster -
i.e. the cluster can continue serving traffic during upgrade.
Please read the release notes for any additional steps that may
need to be performed during the upgrade.
</p>

<ol>
  <li id="before-update"><strong>Before Upgrading a Node</strong>
    <ul><li>
        To save downtime, push software packages to the hosts in advance.
    </li></ul>
  </li>

  <li id="config-server"><strong>Upgrade Config Server(s)</strong>
    <ul><li>
      For all nodes in the cluster, detach config proxies from
      the config server(s) by running this command on all hosts (this makes
      sure that services keep their current configuration until both config
      server and the services themselves have been upgraded):
      <pre class="brush: cli">$ configproxy-cmd -m setmode memorycache</pre>
    </li><li>
      Activate packages on the config server(s) and restart.
    </li><li>
      Redeploy and activate the application:
      <pre class="brush: cli">$ deploy prepare &lt;app&gt; &amp;&amp; deploy activate</pre>
    </li><li>
      Restart services on the configserver node(s) -
      the config proxy will then go back to using the default mode and
      serve config from the upgraded config server(s).
    </li></ul>
  </li>

  <li id="admin-node"><strong>Upgrade Admin Node(s)</strong>
    <ul><li>
      The second step is to upgrade the rest of the admin nodes in the
      system (those specified in <em>&lt;admin&gt;</em> in <em>services.xml</em>).
      Upgrade each of the nodes as follows, one and one at a time:
      stop, install, start.
    </li><li>
      If the config server(s) is deployed on admin node(s), these nodes
      are already upgraded as part of the first step.
    </li></ul>

  <li id="cluster-controller"><strong>Upgrade the Cluster Controller</strong>
    <ul><li>
      The system will work with no interruption when the Cluster Controller stops.
      (Cluster controller nodes can be found by running
      <em>vespa-model-inspect service container-clustercontroller</em>)
      To upgrade: stop, install and start.
    </li><li>
      You will see warning log messages from the other nodes in the system
      while the cluster controller is down - this is normal. Note that
      if the Cluster Controller is deployed on an admin node, it is upgraded
      as part of the admin node upgrade.
    </li></ul>
  </li>

  <li id="storage-nodes"><strong>Upgrade Content Nodes</strong>
    <ul><li>
      Upgrading a content node implies stopping both a distributor and a content
      node. Note that the procedure below only needs to be followed if you
      need to have your data available for serving during the upgrade procedure -
      if not, just stop the full Vespa cluster as-is.
    </li><li>
      You should only stop <em>redundancy-1</em> nodes at a time - if
      you got, say 2, copies, stop and upgrade only one node at a time:
      stop, install start - then wait for content node initialization
      and redundancy merge (application dependent)
    </li><li>
      The wait period must be adjusted to the time it takes for a content
      node to initialize. This initialization period depends heavily on whether we have
      an indexed, streaming or store-only content cluster.
      You can look at health status to see progress.
    </li></ul>

  </li>
</ol>
