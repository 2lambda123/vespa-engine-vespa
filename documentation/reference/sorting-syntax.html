<h2>General query result sorting</h2>


    <p class="ingress">
      This document provides a description of how to sort results in Vespa.
    </p>

    <p>
      A sorting specification in a query consists of one or more
      sorting expressions. Each sorting expression is an optional sort order
      followed by an attribute name or a function over an attribute.
      Multiple expressions are separated by a single SPACE character.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using more than one sort expression will give you multilevel
      sorting. In this case, the most significant expression is the
      first, while subsequent expressions detail sorting within groups
      of equal values for the previous expression.
    </p>

    <pre class="code">
Sorting       ::= SortExpr ( ' ' SortExpr )*
SortExpr      ::= [SortOrder] SortObject
SortObject    ::= SortAttribute | Function
Function      ::= LOWERCASE '(' SortAttribute ')' |
                  RAW '(' SortAttribute ')' |
                  UCA '(' SortAttribute [ ',' Locale [ ',' Strength] ] ')'
LOWERCASE     ::= 'lowercase'
UCA           ::= 'uca'
RAW           ::= 'raw'

Strength      :: 'PRIMARY' | 'SECONDARY' | 'TERTIARY' | 'QUATERNARY' | 'IDENTICAL'

SortAttribute ::= ID                          /* A valid attribute name */</pre>



    <h2 id="sort-order">Sorting order</h2>
    <p>
      For sort order, <code>+</code> denotes ascending sorting order,
      while <code>-</code> gives descending order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ascending order is defined as lowest values first for numerical
      attributes. Strings are sorted according to the sort function chosen.
      Descending order is the reverse of ascending order.
    </p>

    <p>
      If +/- is omitted, the default will be used, either the system wide default of <code>+</code>
      or any override in <a href="search-definitions.html#sorting">searchdefinition</a>.
      Also note that when composing the query URL, <code>+</code> has to be encoded as %2B.
      For consistency, <code>-</code> can be encoded as %2D.
    </p>

    <h3 id="default-sort-order">Default sorting order</h3>
    <p>
      Default sort order is <code>+</code> or ascending, except for the special builtin <code>[rank]</code> which has <code>-</code> or descending.
    </p>

    <h2 id="sort-attribute">Sorting attribute</h2>
    <p>
      The sorting attribute in a sort expression is the name of an
      attribute in the index. Attribute names will often be the same
      as field names. In the search definition, an attribute is
      indicated by the indexing language fragment for a field having
      an <a href="search-definitions.html#attribute">attribute</a>
      statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      When sorting on attributes, it is recommended to use the built
      in <em>unranked</em> rank-profile, this allows the search kernel
      to execute the query significantly faster then execution the
      ranking framework for many hits and then finally ignore this
      score and sort by the specificed sorting specification.
   </p>

    <h2 id="sort-function">Sorting function</h2>
    <p>
      It is possible to specify how sorting should be done.
      The default depends on configuration of attributes and
      language, if specified in query.  Fallback when no
      sorting could be done is using the order that
      the documents were indexed in (on the backend search node).

      You can specify that you want to sort on raw binary values, or a
      simple and cheap lowercase, but usually the more expensive, but
      linguistically correct
      <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/">UCA</a>
      sorting will be used.
    </p>


    <h3 id="raw">Raw byteorder</h3>
    <p>
      Here a simple and fast ordering based on memcmp of utf8 for
      strings and correct sort order compliant binary rep for other
      fields is done. However that is not correct for anything except
      computers looking only at the binary representation.
    </p>


    <h3 id="lowercase">Lowercase</h3>
    <p>
      This improves the sorting by first lowercasing and normalising the strings before sorting. This is
      slightly more correct and might be enough for what you want. It is not that much more costly than raw sort.
    </p>

    <h3 id="uca">UCA</h3>
    <p>
      This sorting is based on the
      <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/">icu</a> library that follows the
      <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/">Universal Collation Algorithm</a>.
      The specification of
      <a href="http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/util/ULocale.html#ULocale(java.lang.String)">locale</a>
      and <a href="http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/Collator.html">strength</a>
      are identical to
      how <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/">icu</a> specifies
      them. The default is strength <code>PRIMARY</code> which only
      sorts on primary differentiating characteristics; this means that
      letters in uppercase/lowercase or with differences in accents
      only are considered equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that both locale and strength are optional, but that if you
      need to set strength you must also specify locale.
    </p>

    <h4>Default sort locale</h4>
    <p>
      Locale is default derived from query unless overriden in
      <a href="search-definitions.html#sorting">searchdefinition</a>,
      or given explicitly in sortspec.  Note that if neither the query
      sortspec, nor the searchdefinition, nor the query itself
      specifies a language or locale then UCA sorting won't be used by
      default anymore; in this case the fallback is to use the
      lowercase function instead.
    </p>

    <h4>Default sort strength</h4>
    <p>
      Strength is <code>PRIMARY</code> unless overriden
      in <a href="search-definitions.html#sorting">searchdefinition</a>,
      or given explicitly in sortspec.
    </p>


    <h3 id="default-sort-function">Default sort function</h3>
    <p>
      Numeric fields are sorted based on their numerical value. This is the only option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default for strings are <code>uca</code> unless overriden in
      <a href="search-definitions.html#sorting">searchdefinition</a>,
      or given explicitly in sortspec.
    </p>

    <h2 id="special-sorting-attributes">Special sorting attributes</h2>
    <p>
      Three special attributes are available for sorting in addition to
      the index specific attributes:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>[relevance]</dt>
      <dd>
        The document's relevance score for this query. This
        is the same as the default ordering when no sort specification
        is given ([rank] is a legacy alias for the same thing).
      </dd>

      <dt>[source]</dt>
      <dd>
        The document's source name. This is only relevant when querying multiple sources.
      </dd>

      <dt>[docid]</dt>
      <dd>
        The document's identification in the search back end. This will
        typically give you the documents in indexing order. <strong>Keep in mind that this id is unique
        only to the backend node where the document resides</strong>. The same document might have different id
        on a different node. The same way a different document might have the same id on another node.
        This is just intended as a cheap way of getting an almost stable sort order.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      These special attributes are most useful as secondary sort
      expressions in a multilevel sort. This will allow you to sort
      groups of equal values for the primary expression in either
      relevancy or indexing order. Without this additional sort
      expression, the order within each equal group is not
      deterministic.
    </p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Note that it is only possible to sort on attributes</strong>. Trying
      to sort on a plain field, without an associated attribute, will
      not work. Trying to sort on a multivalued attribute will also
      not work; the sort expression will be ignored.
    </p>

    <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
    <pre class="code">+surname</pre>
    <p>
      Sort the hits according to the surname attribute in ascending
      order.
    </p>

    <pre class="code">+lowercase(surname)</pre>
    <p>
      Sort the hits according to the surname attribute in ascending
      order after lowercasing the surname.
    </p>

    <pre class="code">+uca(surname,en_US)</pre>
    <p>
      Sort the hits according to the surname attribute in ascending
      English US locale collation order.
    </p>

    <pre class="code">+uca(surname,nb_NO)</pre>
    <p>
      Sort the hits according to the surname attribute in ascending
      Norwegian 'Bokm&aring;l' locale collation order.
    </p>

    <pre class="code">+uca(surname,nb_NO,TERTIARY)</pre>
    <p>
      Sort the hits according to the surname attribute in ascending
      Norwegian 'Bokm&aring;l' locale collation order, but more attributes
      of a character are used to distinguish. Now it is case sensitive and
      'aa' and 'Ã¥' are different.
    </p>

    <pre class="code">+surname -yearofbirth</pre>
    <p>
      Sort the hits on surnames alphabetically, with the youngest ones
      first when the names are equal.
    </p>

    <pre class="code">+yearofbirth -[rank]</pre>
    <p>
      Sort the hits in ascending birthyear groups, and sort by
      relevancy within each group of equal values with the highest rank
      first.
