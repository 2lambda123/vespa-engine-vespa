<p>
This article describes the API for health and metrics for a service in Vespa.
</p>


<h1 id="health">Health API</h1>
Health status can be found by HTTP GET at <code>http://host:healthport/state/v1/health</code>


<h2 id="health-example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">
{
  "status" : {
    "code" : "up",
    "message" : "Everything ok here"
  }
}
</pre>

<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>
The status code can either be <code>up</code> or
<code>down</code>. Status <code>up</code> means that it is fully up,
ready for serving traffic. If the page cannot be
downloaded, a state of down is typically assumed.
</p>

<p>
The message part is optional. Typically it is empty if the service is
up, while it is set to a textual reason for why it is unavailable if
that is the case.
</p>


<h1 id="metrics">Metrics API</h1>


<h2 id="metrics-example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">
{
  "status" : {
    "code" : "up",
    "message" : "Everything ok here"
  },

      }
    ]
  }
}
</pre>




<h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h2>

<p>
Metrics are reported in snapshots, where the snapshot specifies the
time window the metrics
are gathered from. Typically, the service will aggregate metrics as
they are reported, and after each snapshot period, a snapshot is taken
of the current values and they are reset. Using this approach, we can
also track min and max values, and possibly more advanced values like
95% percentile for each complete snapshot period.
</p>

<p>
A sliding window would of course be preferrable so one always got the
metric values from now and some time back, but aggregating metrics on
the fly is more complex and occupies more memory. Typically a
non-sliding window is used, so the service should report its last full
window snapshot.
</p>

<p>
The from and to times are specified in seconds since
1970. Milliseconds or even microseconds can be added as decimals if
wanted.
</p>

<p>
If you include metrics from other sources where you are not in control
of the snapshot window, ideally you would aggregate and convert so you
get values for the same snapshot window. But for practical purposes
you can likely fake the values.
</p>


<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<p>
A flat list of metrics are sent. Each metric value reported by a user
should be a separate metric. If you have related metrics, current best
practice is to prefix metric names with common parts and dot separate
the names. For instance <code>memory.free</code>
and <code>memory.virtual</code>. Each metric have one or more values
set. The currently possible values are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>count</dt>
  <dd>Number of times metric has been set. For instance in a count
      metric counting number of operations done, it will annotate the
      number of operations added for that snapshot period. For a value
      metric, for instance setting latency of operations, the count
      will set how many times latencies have been added to the
      metric.</dd>

  <dt>average</dt>
  <dd>The average of all the values gotten during a snapshot
      period. Typically sum divided by count.</dd>

  <dt>rate</dt>
  <dd>count/s.</dd>

  <dt>min</dt>
  <dd>The smallest value seen in this snapshot period.</dd>

  <dt>max</dt>
  <dd>The largest value seen in this snapshot period.</dd>

  <dt>sum</dt>
  <dd>The total value seen in this snapshot period.</dd>
</dl>
