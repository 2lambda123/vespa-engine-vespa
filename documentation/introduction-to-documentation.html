<p class="ingress">
This documentation is for users of Vespa, or potential users - being
application owners / PMs, engineers or operators. The documentation
covers conceptual overviews of the product, including some of the
background theory and explanations of why the product has developed
along the lines it has. This is followed by deeper investigation of
the features that developers will use first.
</p>

<p>
For Vespa plugin development, the documentation is aimed at
experienced Java developers.  It is not aimed at beginners and does
not cover general programming techniques or the basics of programming
languages.
</p>

<p>
For parts of the documentation the reader should be familiar with
Unix-like platforms, as Vespa is available on Linux.  The exposure of
Vespa's APIs is such that the user does not need in-depth knowledge
about how Vespa's inner workings in order to start using it.  The
reader does not have to be an expert by any means, but the text and
samples become easier to follow as Vespa's principles are more
properly understood.
