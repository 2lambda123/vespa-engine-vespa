 * @class DiskThread

 * @brief Implements the public API of the disk threads.
 *
 * The disk threads have a tiny interface as they pull messages of the disk
 * queue themselves. Thus it is easy to provide multiple implementations of it.
 * The diskthread implements the common functionality needed above, currently
 * for the filestor manager.
