This document explains how to set up a multinode Vespa system.
Readers are expected to know how to 
<a href="../vespa-quick-start.html">set up a single-node system</a>.
Installing Vespa (on each node), deploying applications, 
feeding data and searching is done the same way 
as described in the quick-start for single-node instances.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
Before setting a system into production, it is a good idea to
do <a href="../performance/sizing-search.html">sizing</a> and
<a href="../performance/vespa-benchmarking.html">benchmarking</a>
exercise to detemine how many nodes you need to meet capacity.
For production systems the smallest size of any cluster should
be 2 for redundancy. The same nodes may run multiple clusters
at the same time.
</p>

<h1 id="step-by-step">Installing and Running Step-by-Step</h1>

<li><strong>Install:</strong>

<p>Install Vespa on each node exactly as you would for a single-node
instance. Even though the nodes may have different roles, they all have exactly the
same software packages.

<li><p><strong>Create a multinode application:</strong>

We'll extend the example application in
<code>$VESPA_HOME/share/vespa/sampleapps/search/music</code> to specify multiple nodes. 

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ cd [your working directory]
$ cp -r $VESPA_HOME/share/vespa/sampleapps/search/music music-multinode
</pre>

<p>
List all the host that should be part of the system in
<em>music-multinode/hosts.xml</em>. For example
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;hosts&gt;
  &lt;host name="node1.host.com"&gt;
    &lt;alias&gt;config0&lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;/host&gt;
  &lt;host name="node2.host.com"&gt;
    &lt;alias&gt;container0&lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;/host&gt;
  &lt;host name="node3.host.com"&gt;
    &lt;alias&gt;content0&lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;/host&gt;
  &lt;host name="node4.host.com"&gt;
    &lt;alias&gt;content1&lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;/host&gt;
&lt;/hosts&gt;
</pre>

<p>The hosts.xml file simply provides an alias for each hostname such that the services file can refer to hosts by alias. The aliases are just ids and carry no meaning.</p>

Now, modify <code>music-multinode/services.xml</code> as follows:
<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;

  &lt;admin version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;adminserver hostalias="<span class="marker1">config0</span>" /&gt;
    <span class="marker1">&lt;slobroks&gt;
      &lt;slobrok hostalias="config0"/&gt;
      &lt;slobrok hostalias="container0"/&gt;
    &lt;/slobroks&gt;</span>
  &lt;/admin&gt;

  &lt;jdisc version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;search /&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;
      &lt;node hostalias="<span class="marker1">container0</span> /&gt;
    &lt;/nodes&gt;
  &lt;/jdisc&gt;

  &lt;content id="music" version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;redundancy&gt;2&lt;/redundancy&gt;
    &lt;documents&gt;
      &lt;document type="music" mode="index" /&gt;
    &lt;/documents&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;
      &lt;node hostalias="<span class="marker1">content0</span>" distribution-key="0"/&gt;
      <span class="marker1">&lt;node hostalias="content1" distribution-key="1"/&gt;</span>
    &lt;/nodes&gt;
  &lt;/content&gt;

&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>


<p>
We have replaced all node1
references with the appropriate node alias for the new multinode
layout. We also added a new
<a href="slobrok.html">location broker</a> node for redundancy. For
content, we have changed the redundancy (number of copies of
each document) from 1 to 2, and added a new content node.
Notice that it is possible to run any combination of services
on the same node by adding the same alias multiple places.
It is also possible to make changes to the set of nodes
and redeploying while the system is serving queries and receiving writes.
When you make changes to content clusters the system will gradually redistribute
the stored data to the new nodes.
</p>

<p>
    Explanations of the different parts
    of <code>services.xml</code> are found in the <a
    href="../reference/application-packages-reference.html">application
    package reference</a> doc.
    The <a href="../service/performance/hardware-recommendations.html#allocation">Recommended
    hardware configuration</a> doc
    gives some recommendations on the service distributions in multinode
    setups.
</p>


<li><p><strong>Start config server(s):</strong> All vespa nodes need
to know where to find the vespa config servers of the system as that will tell them what they should do
(which again is determined by your application package). In addition, Vespa needs to be started on each node.
</p>

<p>On each node, run
<pre class="brush: cli">
TODO: Command to set config server host # Use a comma-separated list when specifying multiple servers
TODO: Command to start services
</pre>

<p>
In addition, you need to start the config server on the nodes listed under the admin service in services.xml only:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
TODO: Command to start config server
</pre>

</li>

<li><p><strong>Deploy application:</strong>
Now we are ready to deploy the multinode application, whcih is done once on any of the config server nodes,
precisely the same way as for a single node system:

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ deploy prepare music-multinode
$ deploy activate
</pre>

<p>The config server you deploy to will copy the application to any other config servers for redundancy
and determine the detailed configuration to send to each of the other nodes.
Whenever you want to change the application package, just do so and redeploy in exactly the same way.
The config servers will figure out the delta and push it to the other nodes of the system, which
in most cases will apply them safely while live. If the change cannot be safely done while the node
is running it will hold off applying it until it is restarted. In cases where a restart is needed you'll be
notified in the response from running deploy. It is also possible to deploy remotely over a web service API.</p>

<p>With the deploy step the application should be up and running and you can feed data and query it
as described e.g in the quick start. You can use the logfmt command to verify that there are no
ERRORS and WARNINGS in the log. The log on config servers contains the messages from all the nodes in the system
while other nodes only contain their own locally produced messages.</p>
