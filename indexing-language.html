<p class="ingress">
The indexing language is a part of the search-definition which defines
how a field is processed during indexing.
</p>

<p>
In simple mode you specify the operations to be performed separated by
the pipe (<code>|</code>) character, and leave the details to Vespa.
If you have a advanced processing needs, you can either
use <a href="reference/advanced-indexing-language.html">advanced
mode</a> indexing language, or you can write
a <a href="search/docproc-development.html"> document processor</a>.
</p>

<p>
Supported expressions in simple mode are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>attribute</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  Attribute is used to make a field available for sorting and
  grouping.
  </p>

  <p>
  Attributes can be modified by the <code>attribute:</code> command in
  a search definition.
  </p>

  <div class="alert alert-success">
  All data stored in attribute will be kept in memory at all times. It
  is therefore very important to avoid storing too much data in
  attributes, see the <a href="performance/attribute-memory-usage.html">Attribute
  Sizing Guide</a> for details.
  </div>
</dd>

<dt>index</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  Creates a searchable index for the values of this field. All strings
  are lower-cased before they are stored in the index.
  </p>

  <p>
  By default the index name will be the same as the name of the search
  definition field. Optionally a <a href="reference/search-definitions.html#fieldset">field set</a>
  can be specified to combine several fields in the same set for searching.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt>set_language</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  Parses the input value as an RFC 3066 language tag, and sets that
  language for the current document. This affects the behavior of the
  tokenizer. The recommended use is to have one field in the document
  containing the language code, and that field should be the first
  field in your document.
  </p>

  <div class="alert alert-success">
  <p>
  In a search definition, this operation must be placed before any
  indexed fields, as it will only affect the fields defined after it
  in the search-definition. If you have both header and body fields,
  the <code>set_language</code>-field should be header, if you require
  it to affect subsequent header fields and/or any body fields. The
  reason is the fields are iterated header-body when deriving the
  backend configuration for indexing scripts.
  </p>

  <p>
  Please see the <a href="linguistics.html">linguistics</a>
  article for more information on how language settings are applied.
  </p>

  </div>
</dd>

<dt>summary</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  Includes the value of this field in the document summary, i.e. the
  data returned to the user.
  </p>

  <p>
  Summary output format can be modified by using
  the <code>summary:</code> command in a search definition (e.g. to
  make dynamic teasers).
  </p>

  <p data-annotation="Is this limit present also in 5.1?">
  Summary fields of type string are currently limited to 64kB.  If a
  larger string is stored, the indexer will issue a warning and
  truncate the value to 64kB.
  </p>
</dd>
